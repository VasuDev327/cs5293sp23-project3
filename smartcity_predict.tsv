SARTA Smart City Proposal0.0 Project Summary 
In 1805, land surveyor Bezaleel Wells founded 
the City of Canton, OH (the City), naming it after China’s fourth-largest city as a memorial to a long-time trader whom he deeply admired. As the founding place of the National Football League, home of 25th US President William McKinley, headquarters of what was once the world’s largest watch-wo rks, and the location of 
the largest brick/paver company in the region, Canton and its partners are today leveraging the region’s unique and vibran t history into a new 
era of revitalization and growth. To this end, the 
Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) – the Applican t – in partnership with 
the City and over a dozen design and implementation partners, is deeply committed to developing and deploying a data-driven, user-oriented, green, and i ntegrated approach to 
managing transportation and public services.   With planning and implementati on support under DOT’s Smart City  grant, the project team will 
build on its existing regional lead ership in renewable-powered,  smart transit systems and 
services, to create a safer, more accessible, and optimized met ropolitan area. In this way, 
selection and deployment of the Canton Smart City Program (Prog ram or Project) will provide a 
flagship example for the red evelopment, reinvigoration, and gre ening of the Rust Belt, a region 
deeply in need of creative thin king, new ideas, and technologic al development. 
 SARTA and the City’s vision for t he Project seeks to deploy the  proposed Smart City system by 
carefully and thoughtfully interf acing with SARTA’s and the Cit y’s available assets and 
infrastructure. When complete, the Program will implement a Sma rt City system that is at once 
tailored to local needs, while  deploying advanced technologies and systems that provide several 
categories of key benefits in lin e with DOT goals. With a stron g focus on enhanced user 
experience, improved safety, and i ncreased transit and energy e fficiency, major facets of the 
Program will include:   
 Enhanced Connectivity. The Program will take major ste ps to integrate and coordinate 
existing modes of public and person al transit, extending curren t systems by deploying 
infrastructure-based sensors, data tracking and management, and  centralized information 
collection and management syste ms that will significantly enhan ce the quality of 
transportation service deliver y, while also facilitating expans ion into advanced coordination 
of delivery of goods and services. The Program will include a s trong focus on enhancing 
transportation opportunities among existing and proposed infrastructure, including the 
Akron-Canton Airport, the Cant on City core area, and the Profes sional Football Hall of Fame 
and proposed Hall of Fame Village.  
Figure 1:  The City of Canton maintains a rich and 
many-faceted history, and is the birthplace of the National Football League and the Professional Football 
Hall of Fame, which will soon  undergo renovation into 
an amusement park-style Hall of Fame Village. The 
Project promises to deliver $14.7 billion in cumulative 
net total economic output, w ith over 8,200 visitors/day.

SARTA Smart City Proposal Smart System Enabled Adaptability. The Program will deploy advanced data management 
algorithms to allow transit system s to adapt to changes in dema nd, changes in traffic 
conditions, and other conditions such as environmental changes,  ride-sharing, new forms of 
land-use, and multi-modal trip management to support adaptive s ystem management, 
enabling strong improvements t o efficient tran sportation.  
 Monitoring. Under the Program, SARTA’s and t he City’s transportation networ ks will be re-
envisioned to operate as a singl e entity, capable of being monitored, to provide real-time 
status regarding the performan ce and operation of all modes of transportation at any given 
time.  
 Energy and Environmental Enhancement.  The Program will enhan ce, support, and fit into 
SARTA’s existing and anticipate d deployments of advanced low-em ission and zero-emission 
vehicles, including the Midwest r egion’s first deployment of hydrogen fuel cell buses, 
helping to further advance the ag ency as the regional leader in  clean transit. The Program 
will also support the City’s broader plans to provide and devel op an integrated, 
environmentally sustainable, plea sant, and renewable-energy-bas ed living environment with 
upgraded smart infrastructure. 
 Key Infrastructure and Facilities. The Project will also include deployment of new key 
infrastructure and facilities targ eted at enhancing transit and  environmental/greening 
opportunities, including deploymen t of clean vehicle fleets, re newable energy systems, and 
updates to transit infrastructure. 
 
In total, the Program will strongly support DOT’s goals of enhancing mobility, improving safety, and addressing environmental concerns by reducing environmental footprints and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The team will meet these goals by deploying a Smart City system that focuses on a balanced portfolio of technology vision elements (Advanced and Connected Vehicles, Smart Energy, Intelligent Sensor-Based Infrastructure, and Back-Office Infrastructure), smart city vision elements (Smart City Data Collection and Management, Smart Land-Use Management, and Smart Parking), and innovative approaches to urban transportation (Advanced Urban Analytics, Connected and Involved Citizens, Advanced Logistics Management, and User Experience Management).

SARTA Smart City ProposalAs shown in Table 1, the Canton Urb anized Area makes an ideal location for the proposed Smart 
Cities initiative. The Project would make a significant improve ment to local transportation 
optimization, renewable energy, a nd city livabil ity, while also  providing strong support to the 
area’s existing touris t industry. The project lends strong supp ort to a significant planned 
expansion of the NFL Hall of Fame to encompass a theme-park lik e experience, which is 
expected to generate $14.7 billi on in cumulative net economic b enefit, bringing in 8,200 people 
per day to the Canton area. B y interfacing with and supporting the Hall of Fame Village Project 
with smart city and smart transit  systems, the Project will strongly support local economic 
development and tourism, while enabling showcasing of the proposed smart city systems and 
technologies to hundreds of thous ands of visitors to the City e ach year in an unexpected yet 
pivotal location: a historic Rust  Belt city fighting to revital ize and serve as a regional example of 
successful economic development , advanced service, and environm ental sustainability.

1.0 Canton Area Smart City Vision 
1.1 Key Challenges Facing the Canton Area 
Despite its rich history and statu s as the county seat of Stark  County, Canton faces several 
critical challenges, many of whi ch are typical of Rust Belt cit ies. Sluggish economic 
development has been perhaps the most central, long-term challenge for the City. While Canton 
is making meaningful progress to ward recovery from a decades-lo ng urban decline (1960s 
through the 1990s), the City and s urrounding areas have still s truggled to hold up what is left of 
their once-vital manufacturing ba se. For example, leading vacuu m maker Hoover recently 
announced closure of its last re maining facility in North Canto n, representing the final step in the 
company’s withdrawal from its birthplace, where the upright vac uum cleaner was first 
manufactured. Other key challenge s largely relate to the long-t erm loss of industry and resulting 
2/4/2016
4 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalchanges in population dynamics and city infrastructure. Populat ion in the City proper peaked in 
the 1950s at approximately 117,000, but has declined by 2% to 1 5% each decade since. This has 
resulted in several unique challenges, including excess but dec lining infrastructure, low road 
capacities, and urban center 
decay, including loss of retail enterprises. The City has also faced  planning challenges while trying to support economic development, including growth of urban sprawl, and the razing of many historic structures and closing of services.  
1.2 Proposed Smart City 
Elements Will Address Key Challenges 
The Project will provide 
support to mitigating several of t he Project team’s key challenges. The Project will directly and 
strongly address what is likely the most critical challenge fac ed by the Project team – limited 
and/or sluggish economic developm ent. The Project will carefull y integrate with planned 
facilities and operations  of the (separatel y proposed) Hall of Fame Village expansion project, 
which is expected to draw ove r 8,200 visitors per day, on avera ge, to the City. The Project will 
provide transportation support and s mart infrastructure designe d to minimize travel burdens for 
Hall of Fame Village visitors, whi le also helping to link the p roposed Village with retail centers 
and other attractions located in the City (National First Ladie s Library, McKinley Presidential 
Museum and Monument, downtown shops  and hotels, etc.). The Proj ect will also support other 
efforts by the City to revitali ze its downtown core, making tra nsit throughout the City easier, 
more accessible, and safer for all parties involved. Outside of Canton, the Project will further 
support the availability of services to underserved populations, support connectivity among 
Project Area communities, thereby supporting economic developme nt and  
revitalization across the Project Area, and also ease of transp ortation, making the Project a model 
within the region for smart city deployment and implementation.  
 
1.3 Approach to Implementing and Operating the Demonstration Pr oject 
SARTA (the Applicant) and the City will work closely with CalSt art together as team leaders to 
design and implement the Program. While SARTA working with CalS tart will ultimately be 
responsible for overall grant administration ( see Section 1.4),  SARTA and the City will lead and 
coordinate partner agencies/ technology providers during Program  development and deployment, 
with strong project management support provided by CalStart. Ca lStart will also provide the key 
function of measuring the success of the Project. During an ini tial planning phase, SARTA and 
the City will work with other team partners to design the overa ll Project. Other team partners 
will carry responsibility for technical and integration aspects  of the Project, according to their 
areas of specialty and/or needs . During Project operation, SART A, CalStart, and the City will 
oversee and be responsib le for all smart city functionality, equipment, and infrastructure within 
2/4/2016
5 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposaltheir purview. Other team member s – for example the Akron Canto n Airport – may retain 
responsibility for limited functions within the smart city Program (i.e., on site data collection), 
within the Project’s overarch ing collaborative framework. 
 
1.4 Program Management Approach 
The project will deploy a colla borative Program management appr oach, led by the Applicant, 
SARTA, working in close colla boration with the City of Canton, CalStart, and other Project 
partners. As an experienced man ager of federal grant funding, S ARTA boasts a strong 
background in grant program administration and implementation, with experienced staff and 
administration. SARTA also maint ains a large geographic reach, which includes the entire urban 
area considered under the Program. Thus, SARTA will draw on its  experience and geographic 
location as the ultimate administrator of the Program during th e Program during both the 
planning and implementation phases . During the initial planning /Program development phase of 
the Project, SARTA’s management team will work closely with Cit y leadership and other team 
members to plan the proposed P rogram, finalize proposed design,  and identify an 
implementation strategy for the Canton Smart City Program. Duri ng the deployment phase, 
SARTA and the City will collect ively manage and oversee transpo rtation and urban area 
infrastructure/management aspect s of the Program, respectively.  This structure will allow the 
team members to focus on their s trengths: SARTA on deployment of transit oriented Program 
components, and the City on urba n planning, traffic, and other urban-specific project aspects.  
 
2.0 Canton Area Population Characteristics 
The Canton Urbanized Area (Progr am Area) meets all conditions required by DOT in support of 
this application. Bas ed on Census-designated place population f igures from the 2010 census, the 
total population of the Program  Area was 279,245, of which the City of Canton accounted for 
73,007, or 26% of the total populatio n in the Program Area. The  Program Area includes 100% of 
the local urbanized area popul ation, as defined by DOT. Additio nally, the project area contains a 
dense urban core in the City of  Canton, as typical for a mid-sized urban area in the US Midwest. 
SARTA maintains an existing public transportation system, which  serves the entire Program 
Area (see Section 3.1 for additional detail).  
 
3.0 Canton Infrastructure and Planning Elements 
3.1 SARTA’s Existing Public Transit System 
SARTA maintains an extensi ve transit network that 
provides over 2.8 million rides each year in Stark 
County, Ohio. SARTA curre ntly operates 34 fixed 
routes in Alliance, Akron, Canton, Cleveland, Hartville, Jackson Townshi p, Louisville, Massillon, 
North Canton and Uniontown, with 79% of Stark County’s population livi ng within one-half mile of 
one of SARTA’s fixed rout es. In order to provide 
reliable service to as many as possible in Stark County, these fixed routes opera te over 20 hours and more than 7,500 miles each day, Monday 
through Saturday.  SARTA also depl oys the special Proline program, targeted at individuals with 
Figure 3 : SARTA Hydrogen  Fuel Cell Bus 
Prototype.
2/4/2016
6 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposaldisabilities, who are unable to u tilize SARTA’s normal fixed-route system. This countywide 
service picks residents up at their residence (or required orig in) and delivers them to their desired 
destinations. It is a crucial se rvice for thousands of disabled  individuals across Stark County. The 
organization also operates MedLine - non-medical transportation for eligible Medicaid Waiver 
holders, available through the Board of Development Disabilities, supporting employment, adult day support, and vocational training only.   As the Midwest’s budding leader in the demonstration and deployment of efficient, clean 
vehicles and renewable energy technology, SARTA is actively see king out and engaging 
advanced and environmentally fri endly transit vehicle technolog ies. As recently as 2012, 
SARTA did not own a single low- or  zero-emission transit vehicl e. Today, SARTA’s fleet of 100 
vehicles includes 40 converted low-emission compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered transit 
buses and four low-emission diesel-electric hybri d transit buses. SARTA has also committed 
funding (totaling nearly $20 million) for 7 new hydrogen fuel c ell buses, which will be deployed 
into fee service during 2016 and 2017. This growth in the fleet ’s low-emission vehicles 
represents SARTA’s commitment to moving its entire fleet to low - and zero-emission vehicles 
through conversion and new vehicle acquisitions as existing die sel vehicles reach the end of their 
lifespans. In the near term, S ARTA anticipates retaining only 2 5 diesel-powered transit buses, 
with the ultimate goal of a m ostly zero-emissions fleet. 
 
3.2 Amenability of the Area to Smart City Demonstration 
SARTA and the City are highl y amenable to Smart City 
demonstration and deployment. In a ddition to its commitment to 
environmental stewardship, SARTA  as an agency actively supports  
deployment of smart systems and technologies within its service 
area. The agency has made a strong and growing commitment to 
deploying advanced data management and user interface systems 
within its existing transit infrastructure and transit operatio ns. Since 
2010, SARTA has implemented a suite  of advanced data collection  
and management tools designed to o ptimize transit efficiency an d 
enhance rider experience. These  include: (1) PinPoint, a GPS 
system that enables riders to pr ecisely estimate when fixed rou te 
buses will arrive at a given location; (2) GoLine, an online tr ip 
booking system used to book and opt imize booking and routes for 
Proline trips; (3) Google Tran sit Interface, an online trip pla nning 
system for SARTA’s fixed route services that helps users to 
optimize their route and tell passengers when buses will pick them up with 10 minutes; (4) System Map , which shows all of SARTA’s 
fixed routes and their interconne ction points; and (5) Travel 
Training, which trains riders how  to most effectively use SARTA, how to read schedules, and 
how to use PinPoint. With the Pro ject, SARTA is looking to expa nd on its existing experience 
with deploying smart technology to o ptimize transit systems and  support enhanced user services. 
SARTA’s efforts under the Proj ect will build on existing infras tructure and data m
anagement 
systems, enabling an easy trans ition to the further deployment of smart city systems and 
technologies.

SARTA Smart City ProposalThe City of Canton is also we ll-positioned to deploy new smart city technology to enhance 
transit, livability, and safety within the proposed Smart City Component areas. The City is, for 
the first time in 50 years, in t he process of updating its Comprehensive Plan. This anticipated 
update will provide a new framewo rk for the advancement of smar t technologies and smart city 
systems as proposed under the Project. Additionally, Canton’s p lanning staff and officials 
acknowledge the major potential economic, livability, safety, a nd environmental benefits of the 
Project, and strongly support de ployment of the proposed Smart City system within the City. 
 
 3.3 Leadership Commitment and Capacity 
As discussed in Section 3.2, SARTA and City leadership have sho wn a strong and continued 
commitment, including at the lead ership level, to deployment of  smart city systems and 
technologies; the Project will act as a natural extension and e xpansion of these exi sting activities, 
which SARTA and the City strongly embrace and commit to as a me ans to support economic 
growth, livability, safety, and service within the Program Area .  
 
With respect to capacity, SARTA and CalStart maintain administr ative staff with strong 
experience in grant administration and successful grant managem ent. If awarded, SARTA and 
CalStart will allocate experienced staff time to the administra tion, management, and deployment 
of the proposed Canton Smart City Program, and commit to supple menting existing staff with 
training and/or new hires as n eeded to design and deploy the Program. The City of Canton also 
maintains extensive experience  in grant program management and implementation, and has 
deployed a number of grants thr ough the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, as 
well as other housing-oriented bloc k grants. If awarded, the Ci ty will allocate staff with existing 
experience in grant program management and implementation. Similar to SARTA, the City commits to training staff and/or  making new hires needed to des ign and implement the Program. 
 
3.4 Sharing Economy Integration 
The Project team acknowledges significant potential benefits as sociated with the burgeoning 
sharing economy in the United Sta tes. From streamlined and redu ced cost transportation to peer-
to-peer based sharing of goods and access to services, sharing economies can produce significant 
benefits for participants by reducing the costs and economic bu rden associated with the purchase 
of goods and services. Sharing economy integration in support o f the Project will focus on 
transit-oriented services, namely data management and services to enable and facilitate 
ridesharing within the Program Area. Specific facets and implementation schemes for sharing economy integration will be investigated during the Project pla nning phase. Efforts will focus on 
improving and optimizing ridesharing opportunities, with a seco ndary focus on the transport and 
delivery of goods within the Concentrated Smart Vehicle Data an d Communication Area.  
 
3.5 Data Accessibility 
Led by SARTA and the City, the Project team is deeply committed  to supporting data 
accessibility and availability for appropriate use, while also maintaining user and personal and 
corporate privacy and safety as a pplicable. The Project team wi ll share data internally as needed 
to deploy all proposed elements of  the Program
. Where appropria te, the Project team will also 
consider making data availabl e, upon request, to outside public  and private entities, where doing 
so would not expose proprietary information (for example as mai ntained by the United Parcel

the Applicant will work with the remainder of the Project team and US DOT to de velop a series 
of guidelines to govern the sharing o f information collected during the course of Project 
deployment, also supporting open source ridesharing programs. 
 
4.0 Preliminary Site Map 
The project team has completed a Preliminary Site Map, which summarizes existing transit facilities operated by SARTA; points of interest that would be included in the proposed Smart 
City deployment; a Concentrated S mart Vehicle Data and Communic ation Area, where many 
facets of the Project would be deployed; and key proposed Program elements that would be deployed by the Project team. 
Figure 6: Vision Overview   
 
5.2 Technology Vision Elements 
Data Management Centers  
Data management systems will prov ide the operational heart of the proposed smart city function 
and operation. As shown in Figure  6, the proposed data manageme nt centers will include a 
System Master Controller (SMC) , a Traffic Master Controller (TM C), and an Energy Master 
Controller (EMC). 
 
2/4/2016
10 of 74
SARTA Smart City ProposalThe SMC is a supervisory controlle r that will coordinate the wo rk of the TMC and the EMC to 
manage both the transit and energy flows in the system in the best possible way. Data will be 
analyzed from the system to pred ict how to best configure both the movement of people and 
goods, and the movement of energy, s o that the renewable energy  that is produced is utilized to 
its best advantage, and people and goods are moved in ways that are the safest, most sustainable, least costly, and most convenient.  The TMC will draw on data and feedback provided by the proposed  sensor/data collection 
system, via the SMC. It will impl ement advanced and flexible al gorithms designed to optimize 
the movement of vehicles within t he proposed smart city system.  It will interface with SARTA’s 
existing transit operations system, and will also provide feedb ack to other covered entities and 
operations, including interface with freight delivery and manag ement corporations, local 
businesses, ride sharing infra structures, and individual driver s and other indivi duals while they 
are utilizing the proposed smart city system.  The EMC will closely track and manage energy flows associated with the proposed microgrid system. The EMC will seek to conf igure the energy production (from the biodigester and solar 
array as applicable), energy storage (in the batteries on board  charging vehicles, and in the 
proposed battery storage syste m), and energy utilization in suc h a way that the production and 
utilization of renewable energy is maximized. The EMC will also  help to ensure that renewable 
energy in the form of hydrogen (H
2), natural gas (NG), and electri city is produced in sufficient 
quantities to meet the  needs of the SARTA’s transit vehicles, a nd that the maximum economic 
benefit is achieved from this system.  Back Office Infrastructure  
A big data and transportation data  analytics system will be dev eloped and deployed in terms of 
hardware and software. This syst em will have the capability to ingest data from the multiple 
sources, including existing sensors, new sensors, nontraditiona l data sources, and external 
systems. It will have massivel y parallel processing capability to be able to handle the large data 
set involved and be able to bri ng data together into a single d ata hub using an advanced data 
platform. A discovery tool will also be deployed that would ena ble trends and patterns and 
insights to be developed from a n integrated data set. These wil l all be linked through a unified 
data architecture to a data warehouse that will provide a long- term data storage facility. This will 
also be linked to and be coordinate d with the EMC that will be controlling the production of 
renewable NG, H 2 and electricity, as well as ene rgy storage and the interconnection of the smart 
grid with the utility grid.  Advanced, Connected, and Green Vehicles 
Over the course of the Project , the team will deploy a smart tr ansit system that will include a 
pilot fleet of advanced and conn ected vehicles, while also prov iding support for privately owned 
smart vehicles within SARTA’s service area. The proposed vehicl es and data collection systems 
will support SARTA’s existing transit system, while enabling en hanced functionality including 
transit management, ridesharing, and enhanced safety for commut ers, cyclists, and pedestrians. 
These vehicles will use dedicate d short-range communication tec hnologies, and will rely on 
existing and proposed sensory inf rastructure to deliver informa tion to drivers and extract probe 
data from enabled vehicles. The proposed vehicles will all empl oy vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),

driving aids will assess traffic conditions and the status of t raffic signals, and interface with the 
TMC to implement algorithms and vehicle management strategies t hat will minimize fuel  
consumption. Green driving advice  will be displayed for drivers in a simple format, such as a 
green light to speed up, or a red  light to coast, along with al ternate route suggestions designed to  
minimize bottlenecks. 
 The Project will also seek to de ploy additional advanced, clean vehicles and transit systems to 
support City operations. The City is looking to develop its own  fleet of clean, low GHG 
emission, CNG vehicles, and would use the project as starting p oint for development of that 
fleet. Other potential infrastructure to be considered will inc lude smart-design oriented facilities 
and equipment that would directl y support the Proj ect’s goals a s discussed in Section 11. For 
example, the Project will also a dd new SARTA service lines betw een the Airport, downtown 
Canton, and the proposed Hall of F ame Village, to provide enhan ced user support/transit 
opportunities and to support develo pment of the Hall of Fame Vi llage Project. Additional 
proposed SARTA bus lines are als o shown on the Project map (Figure 5) 
 Autonomous Vehicles  
In addition to the proposed smart t ransit system, the Project w ill deploy an autonomous vehicle 
loop (Figure 7) that will include several of the Program Area’s  main attractions, including the 
Akron-Canton Airport, the Belden V illage Commercial Area, the Professional Football Hall of 
Fame Village, Kent State Universi ty, and Stark State College, w hile also providing access to

SARTA Smart City ProposalCanton’s downtown core area. These autonomous vehicles will be 12-passenger, ba ttery electric 
vehicles that SARTA will opera te along fixed routes on Park Dri ve, along an existing greenway. 
When not in use, these autonomous v ehicles will be connected to  the proposed smart-grid to 
support charging as well as gri d energy storage functionality. Charging versus storage 
functionality will be determined adaptively by the proposed TMC  and EMC systems, wherein 
the latter will manage renewable energy production and the smar t grid system. All proposed 
autonomous vehicles would be batter y electric, with charging stations open to the public. 
 
Zero-Emission and Low-Emission Vehicles 
 The proposed smart transit system will make optimal use of zero - and low-emission vehicles by 
building on SARTA’s fleet of 7 adv anced hydrogen fuel cell buse s (currently ordered with 
delivery to be completed by the  end of 2017), plus 13 additiona l hydrogen fuel cell buses that 
will collectively represent one t hird of SARTA’s bus fleet. Additional vans used in ridesharing in 
support of the Project will be de ployed as CNG or battery elect ric vehicles, depending on the 
required duty cycle. Preliminary e stimates completed by SARTA indicate that approximately one 
third of the ride sharing vans n eeded for the Project will be b attery electric, and one third will be 
CNG-fueled. All proposed autonom ous vehicles would be battery e lectric. 
 Smart Energy (Renewable Energy, GHG Reduction)  
SARTA and the City collectively m aintain several key infrastructure elements that, under the 
Project, will be deployed to s upport renewable energy productio n and smart energy generation 
and management. The City’s existing, screen/membrane based sewage treatment facility currently collects and disposes of  solid wastes from incoming f lows. The City proposes to deploy 
a bio-digester system to utilize biosolids and other available organic feedstocks, via anaerobic 
digestion, to produce renewable natural gas (RNG). Once produced, RNG will be cleaned and 
used for at least one of the fo llowing purposes: (1) to be furt her cleaned and compressed for use 
as CNG in SARTA’s existing fleet  of CNG-fueled transit vehicles ; or (2) to be routed to a high 
temperature molten carbonate fuel cell,
1 thereby generating generate ele ctricity used to power the 
proposed smart grid and associated  loads (see below regarding smart grid deployment), hydrogen 
for use as fuel for SARTA’s growing fleet of hydrogen fuel cell  buses, and waste heat to support 
wastewater treatment and/or other processes. In this way, the p roject will sharpl y reduce existing 
GHG emissions associated with the  consumption of fossil fuel th at SARTA currently uses to fuel 
its CNG and remaining diesel-fueled buses, by offsetting heat e nergy consumed during the 
wastewater treatment process and by reducing grid demand for lo ads to be attached to the 
proposed smart grid. The proposed digester will be located at o r adjacent to the  existing Canton 
sewage treatment facility.  
 Intelligent Sensor-Based Infrastructure 
Building on the Canton Urbanized Area’s base of extensive infrastructure-based sensors, this element will plan, design and depl oy new intelligent sensors th at will work in combination with 
existing sensors, while also interfacing with innovative crowdsourcing and motion analytics data collection techniques. The proposed intelligent sensor systems will be deployed in clusters

SARTA Smart City Proposalaround modal interchanges, and als o dispersed in areas where ex isting gaps in sen sor networks 
currently limit data collection efforts.  
 Advanced Traffic Management  
The City’s current/existing advanced traffic management initiat ive will be extended to include 
additional major corridors of de mand that extend from the Akron -Canton airport to downtown 
Canton and associated hotels and commercial areas. This will in clude the deployment of 
adaptive, coordinated traffic si gnal control technology along w ith advanced sensors. Data will be 
used to manage the timing of smart signals, and will also be li nked into the Project’s Data 
Management Centers to support pe rformance management of the ent ire trip chain.  
  
5.2 Smart City Vision Elements 
Smart City Data: Sources  
The Project will rely on several key data sources to support th e proposed systems. These will 
include: (1) Reliance on SARTA’ s and the City’s existing data acquisition systems and 
infrastructure, as described in Section 9.0, as well as new dat a sources including (1) 
crowdsourcing (i.e., via smartphone s); (2) infrastructure senso rs; (3) probe vehicles; and (4) 
motion analytics. The Project will use these data, via the 
proposed data management cen ters and other applicable 
infrastructure, to meet the intended goals and objectives of the Project. If warranted, during the design phase of the Project, the team may elect to substitute or deploy additional data sources.  Smart City Data Collection and Management: Mode 
Specific and Interchange Data Collection 
The Project will incorporate mode-specific data collection serv ices in order to optimize 
transportation performance as w ell as information service delivery. The Project will address, at 
minimum, the modes shown in Tab le 3. Data will also be collecte d at key trans it interchanges 
(Figure 6), to support optimizati on of transit systems while interfacing with ridesharing and other 
proposed elements.   Smart Land-Use Management 
Land use has a significant imp act on the demand for transportat ion, the ability to effectively and 
efficiently satisfy that demand, and on the livability of an ur ban environment. The City is in the 
process of updating its Comprehen sive Plan for the first time i n roughly 50 years. In the interim, 
while attempting to attract economic development, City planners  permitted development of large 
areas of land with limited overs ight – as urban sprawl. The Cit y now recognizes critical benefits 
associated with smart land-us e management, including support for a blossoming urban corridor, 
as well as potential for inter face with other City goals, including deployment of green and smart 
technologies and systems. The planning process for the Project is expected to generate significant input and insight int o how land use interplays with  transportation demand. To best 
take advantage of this unique opportunity, the City proposes to  cross-pollinate Project design Private Car Uber/Equ ivalent Ridesharing

SARTA Smart City Proposalphase activities with the City’s Comprehensive Plan update, ena bling smart city-oriented goals, 
objectives, and policies to be depl oyed within the City’s regular planning outlook.  
 
From a data collection and analy tics perspective, the proposed sensor-based and probe-based 
data collection system, combine d with Smart City analytics capability, will allow the City to 
identify new insights into how l and use affects transportation and city management. This 
information will help refine SARTA’s and the City’s future goal s, beyond the Project, with 
respect to smart city planning a nd urban development. It will a lso empower the City and other 
cities in the region to define smart land-use policies that pro vide multiple benefits, including 
close interface with transporta tion infrastructure and optimization of service delivery. Ultimately, 
through efficient information connectivity proposed under the P roject, the City will leverage its 
mobility hubs to provide better connectivity and a richer user experience overall, for both 
residents and visitors.  Smart Parking 
The Project team will plan and de ploy a smart parking system wi thin the Canton downtown area. 
The proposed system will have event management capabilities, sm art payment capabilities, and 
will provide a revenue managem ent suite for pa rking operations. Smart parking will also support 
variable parking fees. Briefly, the system will deploy sensors as needed to evaluate parking 
demand in real time, and adjust price accordingly. Price adjust ments could be made for the sole 
purpose of optimizing revenue, or  also to encourage people to u se alternate parking infrastructure 
during times of congestion.   
5.3 Innovative Approaches to Urban Transportation Elements 
Advanced Urban Analytics 
The Project team recognizes tha t a much larger amount of data i s now available regarding 
current operating conditions on the  existing tran sportation net work than is effectively utilized by 
the City or by the applicant. The cost of sensors has been redu ced and the availability of 
crowdsourcing techniques, such a s motion analytics and sentimen t analysis of social media, is 
providing transporta tion practitioners with unparalleled insight. The impending tidal wave of 
connected vehicle data adds to this richness while providing ch allenges and opportunities for 
integration into smart city systems. 
 To get the very best from this new availability of data it will  be necessary for a Smart City to 
adopt best-of-breed big data and da ta analytics techniques. This will involve going beyond data 
measurement and reporting into be havioral and predictive analyt ics, collaborative ideation, and, 
eventually, development of a “sentient city,” all of which illu strate the underlying mechanisms 
affecting transportation performance. The Project will facilitate big data utilizati on and analytics 
through its proposed Integrated D ata Warehouse and Unified Data Architecture systems (refer to 
Section 9.2), which will be deployed in coordination with the p roposed SMC, TMC, and EMC.   
 Traffic Management Initiative 
A proposed traffic management initiative will expand on Canton’ s existing traffic management 
initiative, by providing sophisticat ed traffic controllers link ed by telecommunications to the 
central TMC. These roadside devi ces will be capable of managing  traffic signal timings, 
2/4/2016
15 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalcollecting traffic data and collecting data from smart devices and other data sources. This will be 
extended to include major corri dors of demand from the airport to downtown Canton and hotels. 
The system will also include deployment of adaptive, coordinate d traffic signal control 
technology and advanced sensors t o enable the collection of dat a to drive smart traffic signal 
timing. This system will also be expected to provide a feed int o the data management system for 
overall performance manageme nt of the whole trip chain. 
 
Information Services and Management  
 Mode specific information services deployed under the Project w ill provide real-time decision 
quality input and choices to travelers in a context-sensitive m anner. Utilizing physical and 
computing infrastructure propose d under the SMC and TMC, the proposed context-sensitive 
system will take account of current mode of travel, location, and other conditions that affect travel. On modes within the tot al trip chain, information servi ces will be delivered to enhance the 
user experience and provide deci sion quality inp ut to the trave ler. It is expected that these will 
include, at minimum, the following:  
 User engagement to involve users in  the smart city system at th e outset of a trip, and to 
continue to contribute user-gen erated content (including reviews, helpful tips for fellow 
travelers, feedback on local busin esses and services, etc.) thr ough the end of their trips;  
 Opportunities to engage ser vice providers in dialogue; 
 Location- and mode-specific services; 
 Travel information including cos t of travel, timing, reliabilit y, and optional modes and 
routes; 
 Travel time on current mode and options. 
 
At interchange nodes wi thin the total trip chain, information s ervices will be delivered to 
enhance the user experience and pr ovide decision quality input to the traveler. It is expected that 
functionality at service nodes will include similar services to  those identified for mode specific 
information, above.  Smart Grid 
As shown in Figure 6, the Project  will deploy an integrated sma rt grid, which will build on 
SARTA’s and the City’s existing infrastructure, and existing ad vanced, energy-efficient transit 
systems. The proposed anaerobic bi o-digester, located at the Ci ty’s existing sewage plant, will be 
the primary source of renewable  energy to the smart grid, which  would also include utility grid 
power connection, an optional so lar array having a capacity in the hundreds of kilowatts, and 
optional battery storage. The smart grid will connect these pow er sources to the existing sewage 
plant, to the recharging station f or the battery electric auton omous vehicles, and to ridesharing 
service vans. Hydrogen from the proposed fuel cell (see prior d iscussion) will be transported, via 
pipe, to SARTA’s hydrogen fueling st ation, while refined renewa ble CNG will be compressed 
and deployed at SARTA’s existing CNG fueling stations.   Smart grid functionality will allo w the proposed battery-electr ic vehicle charging center to use 
charging electric vehicles as a temporary source of power, whic h would be sent back onto the 
2/4/2016
16 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalsmart-grid during periods of  high utility demand. The smart gri d will have a control system (the 
EMC, described above), which will configure the energy producti on, storage (in compressed 
hydrogen, CNG, and optional batteri es both on the smart-grid an d in the charging battery electric 
vehicles), and energy exchanged on the utility grid, so as to m aximize the benefit to the transit 
system. The EMC will coordinate closely with the TMC and weathe r and traffic predictions to 
develop a strategy for energy pr oduction, storage, and exchange  with the utility grid. 
 
Connected, Involved Citizens 
Recent statistics show that more than 90% of people have access  to a cell phone and that more 
than 60% of the cell phones are capable of operating as a smart phone. For example, it is possible to purchase a track phone from Wal mart for $10 with full voice, text and Internet access 
capabilities. It is becoming obvi ous that the cell phone and a smart phone are becoming powerful 
tools in connecting and involving citizens. It is expected that  the Project will feature extensive 
use of these devices for both information delivery and for prob e data collection techniques in 
order to gain a detailed unders tanding of people movements and the use of the various modes 
within the multimodal travel cha in. It is also expected that ci tizen and visitor sentiment with 
regard to their transportation experiences will be measured on a continuous basis using the same 
devices.  Advanced Logistics Management  
A significant proportion of urba n transportation demand is generated by the need to move goods 
around the City. An efficient smart city will be able to sense and understand the ebb and flow of 
freight delivery and logistics de mand and provide insight in how to optimize this element of 
transportation. The Project will partner with private companies , including UPS and FedEx, and 
possibly other service providers s uch as the US Postal Service (USPS).  Facilitating urban 
delivery and logistics means a ddressing and even anticipating the bottlenecks and pinch points in 
the current system, something t hat can be better  understood in terms of the related data. An urban 
freight delivery project will be conducted in close association  with FedEx and UPS. The 
objectives of the urban freight  delivery project will be to take full advantage of new data, 
combined with data available f rom FedEx and UPS, and to make use of the analytics capability 
of the back office infrastructure . This project will result in new insights into optimum routing 
and timing for the routes take n by urban freight delivery and Utica shale support vehicles. 
 Smart Apps and Crowdsourcing  
An expanded range of smart apps will be developed to provide en hanced basic services and pay-
as-you-go premium services (i.e ., initially focusing on parking  and transportation services, with 
potential for expansion to othe r services over time), as well a s services to reach out to the 
underserved. The proposed smart apps will interface with and/or  expand on SARTA’s existing 
suite of transit oriented apps, a nd will also support social sentiment analysis to de termine traveler 
satisfaction on a continuous basis. The proposed data managemen t system (see prior discussion) 
design and interface will explicit ly consider the requirements of smart phone app developers 
with respect to ease of acce ssing a logical data hub on which t o build their services. The apps 
will also help to link the underserved with aid groups such as foundations helping specific 
portions of the underserved commu nity, as well as public aid. S mart apps will also be 
2/4/2016
17 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalincorporated into crowdsourcing da ta collection efforts, to hel p acquire critical data related to 
current mode of travel and current travel conditions.   
 User Experience Management 
A specific focus will be placed on the use of data and analytic s and the new understanding of the 
total trip chain to optimize user  experience through a variety of management techniques. It is 
expected that these management  techniques will use information delivery via smart phone and 
other information display devices , connected vehicle technology and will address both the 
rectification and mitigati on of associated issues.  
 
6.0 Risks and Risk Management 
The team has designed the Project to minimize risk as practicab le. Nonetheless, some degree of 
risk is unavoidable. Key areas  of risk include technical risk, policy risk, and institutional risks 
associated with deployment of the proposed Project/vision.  
 
Technical risks of the Project can be broken int o two primary categories: risk s associated with 
reliance on and interfacing with e xisting infrastructure (exist ing tech risks), and risks associated 
with the proposed infrastructur e and systems/operations (potential tech risks). Existing tech risks 
stem from the proposed relian ce on systems that may be founded on older standards or older 
infrastructure, and which may not  be fully compatible with the proposed system. Based on a 
preliminary review of available infrastructure, the Project tea m anticipates that these types of risk 
will be limited. SARTA’s existing da ta management, tracking, an d clean energy equipment and 
systems are up-to-date, fully f unctional, and are expected to b e compatible with the proposed 
infrastructure and systems. The Project team will further minimize risk by completing a compatibility review for all existing and proposed systems duri ng the Project design phase. The 
City’s data systems are somewha t older, but are expected to mai ntain interface capability with 
Teradata’s proposed systems ( see Section 7, below). Potential t ech risks are related to the 
potential for failure of propose d systems due to deficiencies o r inadequacies in the proposed 
equipment, or improper planning a nd deployment of the proposed equipment. The Project will 
minimize these potential risks through continued reliance on co mmercially available and 
tested/proven infrastructure and data collection and management systems. Additionally, the team 
will vet all proposed technologies during the design phase.  
 
Policy risks relevant to the Project are limited. Ohio does not presently ma intain restrictions or 
guidance on the deployment of unm anned vehicles, as is the case  in some states. City and 
SARTA policy are considered favorable to deployment of the Proj ect, which is strongly in line 
with the goals and objectives pr oposed under SARTA’s current 5- year plan. City policies and 
planning are currently under revi sion (under a separate initiative), and the City plans to use the 
design phase of the Project to ful ly evaluate and update City p olicies to ensure compatibility with 
the proposed Project, as warrante d. Where unanticipated conflic ts or deficiencies in policy are 
identified for SARTA or the C ity, both entities are committed to deploying the Project, and 
would work quickly to alleviate such issues.   
 
Institutional risks  for the Project team would als o be limited. The Project would align very 
closely with SARTA’s existing st rategic direction (as discussed  above and in Section 12.1), and 
2/4/2016
18 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalalso with the City’s charge to support economic development, sa fety, and environmental 
sustainability. The Project would not include elements that wou ld conflict with or interfere with 
institutional governance or manag ement. While the Project would  involve participation by 
universities (see Se ction 7.1), equipment and facilities would be deployed almost entirely off-
campus and without being owned or operated by a university, min imizing potential for 
institutional risks. Although ins titutional risks are anticipat ed to be minimal, the project would 
complete a thorough review of potential institutional risks dur ing the Project design phase, in 
order to ensure compatibility. A ny potential risks identified w ould be minimized in collaboration 
with DOT as warranted. 
 
7.0 Partnership 
 
7.1 Team Partners and Stakeholders 
The Project would involve a diverse team of public entities, pr ivate corporations, and 
university/research org anizations that woul d collaborate to des ign and deploy the proposed 
Project. Final roles of each project team member and partner wi ll be definitively finalized during 
the initial planning process. Nonetheless, the following list of partners and stakeholders provides 
an inventory of Project partici pants, while highlighting antici pated roles. Key team partners and 
stakeholders include:  SARTA 
As the local transit agency and lead applicant, SARTA will play  a 
significant role in the development and operation of the Progra m. 
SARTA maintains a long-term, forward-looking commitment to deploying smart systems, including smart and low/no emissi on vehicles, as well as intell igent interfaces designed to 
support ease of use/user convenience, system optimization, ener gy savings, and deployment of 
enhanced services to underserved communities. SARTA will also m ake available provide transit 
and other data that it collects under existing conditions, and under the proposed Project, for use 
by the proposed Data Management C enters. SARTA maintains a long -term commitment to 
deploying advanced transit technologies and systems, and is alr eady establishing itself as a leader 
and regional hub for the integra tion and deployment of clean tr ansit systems, having successfully 
won $8.9 million in prior federal grant funding in 2014. SARTA is currently pursuing additional 
grant funding from a number of  sources and strategic partnerships. Finally, SARTA is committed 
to providing outreach a nd services to the underrepresented. The  primary population that SARTA 
serves maintains an income of under $17,000 per year, and over half of SARTA’s ridership is of 
African-American descent. For more about SARTA’s existing trans it system, see Section 3.1. 
 City of Canton  
Canton maintains extensive experi ence in effectively administer ing, and 
rapidly and successfully deploying f ederal grant programs, including 
homeowner support programs thr ough the US Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD), as well as community development block grant and emergency solutions grant programs. Canton maintains a wide array of existing public services and infrastructure, described thr oughout this proposal, which it will bring to support the Project. 
2/4/2016

SARTA Smart City ProposalDuring the planning and deployment  phases of the Project, the C ity will work closely with 
SARTA to help manage developmen t and implementation of the Proj ect, while also coordinating 
internal resources and supporting outreach and collaboration wi th other Project partners.  
 
CalStart 
CalStart is a national strategic broker for the clean and smart transportation industry, dedicated to growth of a clean transportati on industry that will create high  quality economic opportunities, 
reduce GHG emissions, and support smart growth and infrastructu re development. CalStart 
oversees and manages tens of  millions of dollars in grant funds  each year, and will provide 
administration support and documentation of benefits/successes for the Project.  Ohio Department of Transportation (DOT) 
The Ohio DOT oversees transportat ion-related infrastructure 
within the state. Ohio DOT supports conventional automotive 
transit, as well as smart tra nsit solutions, including but not limited to enhancement of bicycling 
and other alternative transportation opportunitie s. As relevant  to the Project, the Ohio DOT is 
expected to play a significant advisory and regulatory role in all surface transportation elements 
of the Project. It is envisioned that Ohio DOT will also provid e traffic and other transportation 
data, which will be fed into the proposed data management syste m.  
 Akron-Canton Airport 
Akron-Canton Airport is a commerc ial airport serving the Projec t area and greater 
vicinity, located approximately 10 miles northwest of Canton. In operation since World War II, the airport currently serves primarily as a regio nal passenger 
airport. The Airport is in the  process of implementing a 10-yea r, $110-million 
Capital Improvement Plan, whic h will culminate in 2018. Akron-C anton Airport 
will be expected to provide data w ith regard to aircraft arriva ls and the flow of travelers to and 
from the airport, to support multi-modal travel management unde r the Project. The airport will 
also be expected to play an act ive role in the understanding an d enhancement of the user 
experience through the airpor t phase of user trips. 
 Ohio State University (OSU) and Additional Public Partners and Stakeholders 
The Ohio State University, Center for Automotive Research (OSU-CAR) is an acknowledged international expert in sustainable mobility, active since the 1970s. OSU-CAR will support ITS 
and will also contribute Big Data management, data sensors, dat a analytics, ride sharing, electric 
vehicles, and renewable energy deployment. Other public partner s and stakeholders include the 
Ohio State University, Kent Sta te University Stark, and Stark S tate College.   
 NFL Hall of Fame 
The NFL Hall of Fame is the fo cal tourist attra ction in the Cit y. The organization 
is currently in the process of pl anning a major expansion which , as discussed 
elsewhere in this proposal, will deploy an amusement-park-like Hall of Fame 
Village focused on providing in-person and interactive experien ces to incoming 
visitors on one centralized campus. As such, the Hall of Fame w ill require careful 
2/4/2016
20 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalplanning and integration with the  proposed smart city system, relying on public and private 
transit opportunities as well as parking services to support it s proposed use. Transportation will 
be a critical element for the Hall of Fame Village’s employees and visitors, and will play into 
visitors’ first experiences of  the updated Hall of Fame campus.  Within the Project the 
organization will be expected t o provide data and also play a significant role in enhancing the 
user experience. As a private sector organization it will also be expected that this partner will be 
seeking to identify ways to monetize the detailed understanding of the trip and to end user 
experience, to better support tourism at its facility and in th e region generally. 
 Airline Partners 
Willing airline partners will be solicited during the planning phase of the Project, for 
incorporation into the Project t eam. Airlines will be expected to provide data about aircraft 
schedules and status, as well as  the flow of travelers into and  out of the Canton system. The 
airlines will play an active role in the understanding and enha ncement of the user experience 
through the airline phase of the trip and through user reservation and related research.  Verizon  
Verizon will be expected to provide data plus communication inf rastructure 
required to collect probe data fr om both vehicles and pedestria ns, transmitting 
this data back to a central loc ation for use by the data management systems in 
support of the Project. The Project team may also work with Ver izon to acquire additional user 
location and other available data , as available and as needed i n support of the Project. As a 
private sector company, Verizon w ill also be expected to identi fy ways to monetize the new 
insights and information regar ding overall trip experience 
 Teradata  
Teradata is a global leader in t he deployment, analysis, and ut ilization of Big Data, specializing 
in deploying big data analytics , as well as data warehousing and integration with existing and 
proposed data sources. Teradata wi ll provide the primary smart city technology needed to 
integrate the proposed data sets from the various stages and el ements of the Project, through the 
overall end-to-end trip, and the ada ptive “sentient” capability  required of a smart city. Teradata 
will also provide the professional services required to extract , transform and load data into a 
central repository, and manage new big data resources that will  grow even during the duration of 
Program deployment. The company will also provide a total hardw are and software solution 
enabling the data to be manage d and analytics and discovery activities to be conducted on the 
integrated data set. During the  Project planning process, Terad ata will work closely with 
SARTA, the City, and other Projec t team members to design a fea sible and high-benefit smart 
city system, in line w ith DOT proposed benefits. 
 Freight Carriers 
The smart transit system will coordinate closely with freight c arriers such as UPS, FedEx, and 
USPS to ensure that goods, as we ll as people, can move through the system efficiently as well as 
safely. By coordinating human tri ps with the planned movement o f goods, all parties will benefit. 
Thus, freight carrier coopera tion is strongly supported, because the TMC will be able to provide 
guidance on how to effectively plan  trip deliveries. Human tran sit will benefit through being able 
2/4/2016
21 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalto coordinate and optimize trips with the movement of goods. In  addition, the movement of 
freight can garner some signal priority consideration (enhancing signal length when possible to 
aid delivery vehicles). Finally, f reight carriers can make excellent use of the full data set, 
applying their own analytics to determine better ways to comple te their individual missions.   
 
7.2 Demonstration Governance Process 
As the Project appli cant, SARTA will ultima tely be responsible for the implementation and 
success of the Project. However, the Project team recognizes th at each team member will carry 
explicit responsibility  in deploying the Pr oject. Chief among t hese, along with SARTA, is the 
City of Canton, which oversees d eployment and governance of all  non-SARTA facilities located 
within its boundary. One key stren gth of the Project is that it  will involve stakeholders; however, 
governance of shared resources ca n prove challenging. The Project’s structure carefully 
considers this potential challe nge in light of local conditions . SARTA already manages transit 
systems throughout the entire Pr oject area, thereby providing a cohesive governance entity for 
applicable facilities across the Project area. Remaining non-tr ansit facilities will remain under 
the control of the local agencies where applicable physical fac ilities and equipment are located, 
but shared status will be mai ntained through contractual agreem ents or equivalent, as applicable.  
 
7.3 Public and Private Partners hips and University Research 
Lead by SARTA and supported by the City, the Project will rely on extensive partnering among 
the proposed Project team, as shown above. During the Project d evelopment phase, team leaders 
will solicit input from all team  members to flesh out the detai ls of the proposed vision for the 
Project. University partners l isted above have already expresse d interest in collaborating as part 
of the Project team, or in an advi sory role in support of the P roject, and their rol es will be refined 
and more closely defined during the initial design phase. Movin g to deployment, SARTA and the 
City will also work closely with team members to develop specif ic partnership structures that

team will implement the proposed partnerships to collectively s upport deployment of the 
proposed Project. The team will also seek out opportunities to incorporate university research 
and/or learning opportuniti es where possible.  
 
8.0 Existing Transportation Infrastructure 
The Canton Urbanized Area (the Pro ject Area) maintains a total of 272 miles of arterials, 79.5 
miles of freeway, and a transit  service promulgated by SARTA that includes 34 fixed routes plus 
shared-use mobility services ( see Section 3.1 for additional de tail). SARTA maintains existing 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Intelligent Commun ication Technology (ICT), 
including transportation manageme nt centers and field equipment within its existing service area, 
supporting its existing operati ons, as discussed in Section 3.2 . There is no smart grid or electric 
vehicle charging infrastructure within the Program Area, althou gh SARTA is completing 
construction of an advance d hydrogen fueling station designed to support its fleet of advanced 
fuel cell buses, which will be deployed starting in late 2016.

9.1 Data currently collected by SARTA and the City 
SARTA currently collects a subs tantial amount of real-time data  on its existing transit fleet and 
operations. SARTA uses these da ta to help commuters to use SARTA’s services more 
effectively, and also to provide  a means for internal tracking and optimization of SARTA 
systems and operation. Data collect ed by SARTA currently includ es real-time speed and location 
information for each transit vehicle in SARTA’s service; passen ger counts as they enter and exit 
buses; point-to-point vehicle tr acking; data col lected through automated phone user interfaces, 
which allow ride reservations through SARTA’s accessibility pro grams; bus scheduling 
information; and data that allo ws for optimization of pickup, d rop-off, and routes for 
accessibility services. The City currently collects data from i ts existing signalize d intersections.  
 
9.2 Data Sharing and Use, Candidate Data, and Cross-Cutting Par tnerships 
The Project team’s current data  collection, storage and analysi s functions are conducted on an 
agency-by-agency basis. This has created disjointed data silos,  reducing the potential for data 
sharing and collaboration among a gencies and potential smart city participants. Worse yet, 
because these data silos are created for use by individual agencies, data in the silos is 
transformed by standard business practices applicable to each. Where collaboration and data 
sharing is needed, for example to support multimodal travel, or development of mobility hubs that incorporate needs of urban f reight and logistics, these si los remain on the sidelines. In 
contrast, the Program will requi re flexibility to connect data at a level of detail that has been lost 
through agency specific practices.  Best-practices in data managemen t will center on the creation o f Integrated Data Warehouses 
(IDW), which will enable development of new data-driven service s by acting as a functional 
repository that allows query by any user at any time. Agency-specific business practices can be integrated into the IDW, and data  is stored only once while being available for use many times 
for different purposes. Under the Program, a logical IDW will s upport the collection and 
2/4/2016

SARTA Smart City Proposalverification of data from all so urces across the smart city inc luding sensor-based, probe-based 
and transit-vehicle-b ased data sources. It will enable data to be utilized from systems such as 
existing advanced traffic management and electronic payment sys tems, and also from 
nontraditional data sources beyond transportation, such as smart card transactions and smart 
electricity grid management systems.    The Unified Data Architecture (UDA) shown in Figure 8 is recognized by information 
technology analysts as best practi ce for enterprises that are centered on creating value from data, 
such as smart cities. The logi cal IDW acts as both a data hub and a data lake, providing the 
capability for all source data integration and the information distribution required by local 
transportation partners and pr ivate sector partners.  
  
Figure 8:  Proposed Data Manag ement Architecture 
 The proposed logical IDW/UDA syst em represents a critical advan cement in data management 
for the Project team, extendi ng far beyond the simple integrati on of data by providing a means 
for facilities and managers to capture and utilize unstructured data sources from the Internet of Things, as well as mobile and consumer/commercial Internet appl ications. Within the proposed 
architecture, the proposed data platform supports the ingestion and verification of data from many sources, while allowing disc overy of trends and patterns i n the data and analytics to guide 
planning, Project delivery, and ope rations and maintenance for the smart city. Collectively the 
UDA system will provide a secure, coherent framework for integrating data and dis tributing data 
with one logical data infrastruc ture, the UDA will provide a framework for maximizing the 
utility of data collected in support of the Project, including supporting key goals of improved 
safety, efficiency, or customer e xperience using real-time data analytics techni ques to provide  
fast insights and management flexibility. Additionally, the pro posed integrated system will break 
down existing barriers among team p artners by enabling cohesive  use of the system, replacing 
current individual and disjointe d data management systems. The proposed system will strongly 
2/4/2016
24 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalfacilitate cross-cutting partner ships in support of data sharing, primarily between the City and 
SARTA, but also among project team  members including universiti es and private  partnerships. 
  
9.3 Data Integration  
The proposed logical IDW/UDA described above will facilitate da ta use for variety of 
applications under the Project. U ltimate details regarding data  use and utility, in light of a new 
collaboration-oriented data management system, require planning level input from Project team 
partners, and will be determine d during the planning phase of t he Project. Nonetheless, the 
Project team anticipates that transit data will be used not only to optimize transportation systems 
under the Project, but also to de ploy safety measures and enhan ce services provided by SARTA 
and the City. Other data, includ ing crowdsourcing and other ava ilable data, would also be 
integrated into the proposed TMS, to further support Project go als.  
 
9.4 Policies 
The City does not currently maint ain Comprehensive Plan policie s relating to the collection, 
management, or sharing of data under the Project. Nonetheless, as described previously, the City 
is presently in the process of updating its milestone Comprehen sive Plan, providing opportunity 
to implement additional guideli nes and policies relevant to sup port smart city deployment.  
 
9.5 Candidate Data for Sharing 
Key targets for data sharing (i.e., candidate data) will focus primarily on transit-related data, 
which is relevant the City and S ARTA, as well as many of the ot her Project team members. 
Certain data subcategories, howev er, will remain proprietary. For example, sharing of parcel 
delivery and management data, whe re it overlays with or mimics data currently collected by UPS 
and other parcel delivery partne rs, may be restricted in order to protect proprietary information 
managed by those entities. Other candidates for data sharing wi ll include data used to support 
enhanced user safety, as we ll as energy management. 
 
9.6 Data Integrity, Sharing Procedure, and Policies 
The proposed Unified Data Archite cture will feature a defense-in-depth approach to information 
security. Combining this approac h with an integrated data wareh ouse (IDW) reduces the 
automatic dispersion of data stor age and minimizes unintentiona l release of data, while 
increasing the overall effectiven ess and managea bility of a com prehensive security program. 
When data is in an IDW, security efforts can be focused and eas ily monitored and maintained 
without the risk of weaknesses in  a single uncontrolled databas e exposing the entire enterprise 
environment to risk. Security fea tures will include: user-level  security controls, increased user 
authentication, support for security roles, enterprise directory, integration, network traffic 
encryption, and auditing and monitoring controls.  
10.0 ITS and Connected Vehicle Technologies 
10.1 Deployment Per Existing Sta ndards, Architectures, and Certification 
To harness the highest value fro m technologies, services, and products, the Project planning 
phase will include deve lopment of a framework that explains how  the various elements will fit 
together and will work together to achieve the objectives. This  will involve the development of a 
2/4/2016
25 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalsmart city architecture, supported by a capability maturity mod el that will provide details 
regarding Project implementati on and deployment. The framework will also define the standards 
to be incorporated into the Project. These will include connect ed vehicle standards that are 
currently developing f or transit signal pr iority, freight, and emergency vehicle applications. 
Current standards will be deploye d, including traffic managemen t data dictionary and the SAE 
J1708/J1587 standard for transit  vehicle area networks. Vehicle  safety applications that use V2V 
and V2I communications will make use of secure, wireless interf aces facilitated by DSRC. 
Standards that have already bee n identified that will be adopte d for DSRC elements include the 
IEEE 802.11p amendment for wireless access in vehicular environ ments (WAVE); the IEEE 
1609.2, 1609.3, and 1609.4 standards for Security, Network Serv ices and Multi-Channel 
Operation; the SAE J2735 Message S et Dictionary; and the emergi ng SAE J2945.1 
Communication Minimum Performance Requirements standard.  
 
 
Figure 9 : System Engineering and Planning Approach. 
 
The Project team recognizes that standards development activity  is dynamic, and that currently 
available standards for many smart city technologies and system s are fluid and still developing. 
One ongoing facet of the Project will be to review emerging and  available standards on a 
periodic basis, so that the late st versions may be incorporated  as relevant into further 
development of the proposed smart city elements, as relevant an d to the extent practicable.  
 All system engineering and planni ng associated with the project will be conducted in accordance 
with Federal Highway Admin istration rules 940.1 through 940.13 and Federal Transit 
Administration policy as published in the Federal Register: Jan uary 8, 2001 (volume 66, number 
5, pages 1455 to 1459). This will involve the application of a formal structured system 
engineering approach, making use of the process illustrated in Figure 9. The activities and work 
products defined therein will be resourced/developed as Project ’s system engineering approach.

10.2 Standards Improvement 
The Project team will document e xperiences with deploying the f rameworks identified under 
item 10.1 in support of the Project , as part of its reporting to the DOT under the Project. 
Reporting will identify any observed deficits in applicable sta ndards, to ultimately help industry 
and standards developers to define and/or refine existing and f uture standards. The Project team 
will focus on lessons learned while deploying applicable standa rds, especially those in the early 
phases of development. In additi on to providing this informatio n to DOT, the Project team will 
make this information available to standards developers upon re quest and approval.

showcase opportunity that will take advantage of the presence o f hundreds of thousands of 
visitors to Canton every year, e xposing them to smart city tran sportation and management 
technology as well as providing s uperb service t o our citizens and businesses. 
 
12.0 Applicant and City Capacity for Project Deployment 
12.1 Executive Commitment 
The Project applicant has dem onstrated strong executive level c ommitment to the Project, and to 
deploying a Smart City within its service area, in collaboratio n with the proposed team. 
SARTA’s board has passed a resolution to submit this grant appl ication, and to wholly support 
the Project. Additiona lly, the Project represents a furthering of SARTA’s existing goals of 
developing data integrated trans it systems that safely serve un derprivileged and other citizens 
within its service area. Specifi cally, the Project would enable  SARTA to further enhance its key 
services, while also supporting d eployment of additional renewa ble energy use for transit, as 
well as other technologies and s ystems as proposed. SARTA aims to become the regional leader 
in clean transit, as well as service through smart systems depl oyment and implementation, and 
the Project would strongly suppor t SARTA’s goals and objectives, as defined within its Five 
Year Development Plan.2 Finally, SARTA has already rec eived an Ohio grant for coordination, 
and the organization is moving forward with a transit review fo r the Hall of Fame Village 
regardless of the outcome of this grant application. The City a lso strongly supports the Project at 
the executive level, and is in t he process of passing a resolut ion that will str ongly support the 
Project, including its initial  design phase, and its implementa tion, if the award is received.  
 
12.2 Workforce Capacity 
As the Applicant, SARTA maintai ns a strong commitment to deploying the project, including at 
the day-to-day management and implementation level. SARTA’s existing staff carry strong 
experience in grant management, deployment, and administration,  and maintain sufficient 
capacity to deploy the initial pl anning phase of the grant. If the deployment grant is awarded, 
SARTA plans to commit existi ng staff to deploying the Project, yet recognizes that additional

2/4/2016
28 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalstaff may be needed in order to install and operate all aspects  of the Project. SARTA will assess 
the potential need for additional staff during the Project design phase, and will acquire additional 
staff, or retrain existing sta ff, as needed to support the Project. The City also maintains a strong 
commitment the project, and plans to commit staff with relevant engineering and design, 
leadership, and grant administration and deployment experience in support of the Project. Staff 
would be initially sourced from existing, qualified City resour ces. However, the City will also 
consider hiring additional, qualified staff as needed for deplo yment of the full Project, if 
awarded. The City will evaluate a vailable and anticipated staff ing needs during the design phase 
of the Project, and will incorporate additional hiring as warra nted if full funding is received. 
 
12.3 Infrastructure Readiness 
SARTA’s existing infrastructure  is discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, above. Briefly, SARTA 
maintains a fleet of 100 transit  vehicles, including 40 convert ed low-emission CNG vehicles, 
plus a minimum of 7 additional hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that  will be deployed by the close of 
2017. SARTA’s transit vehicles are  data-enabled, and include GP S and feedback functionality. 
Other relevant SARTA infrastruct ure includes an existing centra lized data management system 
that interfaces with and supports S ARTA’s user services (see Section 3.2, above). SARTA also 
maintains infrastructure and computing power dedicated to syste m optimization and optimal, 
real-time tracking and management  of its fleet of transit vehic les. These elements are deployed 
via SARTA’s transit centers, loc ated in the City core, Massillo n, and Belden Village. Finally, 
SARTA owns and operates a CNG fue ling station for its fleet of natural gas vehicles, which is 
slated to be upgraded to a combined CNG/hydrogen facility in th e near future. The City employs 
data collection and management f unctions within its municipal b oundaries, including signal 
monitoring and optimization abilities. The City also maintains ownership and operation of its 
existing sewage treatment facil ity, and associated infrastructu re and electrical systems, which 
would be modified under the Projec t. The Project vision has bee n carefully designed to interface 
with and expand on these elements , to be cohesive with existing  facilities, while providing 
additional and enhanced smart systems functionality. Thus the P roject will incorporate available 
infrastructure into the propose d smart city system. A prelimina ry review of available 
infrastructure and proposed technolo gies indicates that availab le infrastructure could be utilized 
to support the proposed smart sys tems. This will be confirmed d uring the Project planning phase.  
 
12.4 Data Performance and Management 
SARTA and the City will maintai n overall oversight of data perf ormance and management, as 
they do currently. However, the t wo entities will be supported by Project partner Teradata 
through deployment of the Project . Teradata’s IDW (see Section 9.2) system boasts linear 
scalability (by adding physical mac hines linearly with growth in data), low cost of ownership, 
and high reliability needed to support growth in data volumes. Teradata’s UDA (see Section 9.2) 
deploys industry-leading best pr
actices for data performance an d management, specifically 
designed for rapidly emerging ne w data sources, as would be dep loyed under the Project. 
Teradata's three-tier architectur e which separates the tasks of  (1) loading data, (2) structuring it 
in such a way that any query can be supported for any user at a ny time, and (3) enabling any 
agency to develop a specific view  for its purposes with its rul es. The Project team anticipates that 
this will allow Project particip ants to create data-driven applications that draw on the data of the 
entire enterprise, by loading it once and using it many times, avoiding the need for multiple 
environments each with its own performance service levels and m anagement costs. Maintaining 
2/4/2016
29 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalone single source copy of enterpr ise data is consistent with ap plicable standards , while creating 
new sources of value from the white space that frequently exist s between data silos. The 
proposed UDA augments the best practice IDW with the Data Platf orm environment, where any 
data can be captured/managed at low cost, and the Discovery Pla tform, which is tailored for 
linking data across the data platform and integrated data wareh ouse.  
 
13.0 Other Financial Resources 
The Project team is committed to advancing infrastructure and p ursuing smart city systems in the 
Project area. To this end, the team is already aggressively seeking and securing additional 
outside funding, that will ultimately support Project implement ation and deployment. The City 
and SARTA view the Project as a  potential planning device for t heir operations and future 
development, and plan to seek a dditional funds to support that vision. The Project team and 
anticipates that in-kind match ma y be available, in the form of  labor and/or facilities that would 
be forwarded by the Project team . With respect to additional cash funding, SARTA has already 
secured $8.9 million in prior federal grant funding in 2014, wh ich is supporting d eployment of 
advanced hydrogen fuel cell vehi cles, to be deployed alongside the Project, and utilized by the 
Project. SARTA has also received grant commitments totaling $4 million from the Ohio DOT, 
$5.4 million from the National Fuel Cell Program, and $2 million from the Federal Transit 
Authority section 5307. SARTA is a lso in the process of pursuin g several additional sources of 
grant funding, including through s trategic partnerships with Oh io State University, as well as 
public/private partnerships rela ting to the deployment of advan ced clean transit technologies.  
 
Various other potential funding mec hanisms may be available to help support the Project. For 
example, as recently as 2013, SARTA, the City of Canton, and th e State of Ohio collaborated to 
deploy major transit updates wit hin the Mahoning Road Corridor and 12th Street. The project 
includes multiple phases to taling over $56 million in work, mad e available primarily through 
state grant funds, with some additional local funding. It is a pinnacle project that closely 
interfaces with other smart city/c omplete streets elements, inc luding those proposed under the 
Project. Key features will incl ude new transit facilities, bike  lanes, road modifications, new 
traffic control systems and a traffic control center, safety im provements, and roadway lighting, 
supporting select elements of tra nsit-oriented development. The Project team will work internally 
and with other local, state, and po ssibly federal agencies to h elp identify additional match 
funding during initial pro ject development.

SARTA Smart City Proposal0.0 Project Summary 
In 1805, land surveyor Bezaleel Wells founded 
the City of Canton, OH (the City), naming it after China’s fourth-largest city as a memorial to a long-time trader whom he deeply admired. As the founding place of the National Football League, home of 25th US President William McKinley, headquarters of what was once the world’s largest watch-wo rks, and the location of 
the largest brick/paver company in the region, Canton and its partners are today leveraging the region’s unique and vibran t history into a new 
era of revitalization and growth. To this end, the 
Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) – the Applican t – in partnership with 
the City and over a dozen design and implementation partners, is deeply committed to developing and deploying a data-driven, user-oriented, green, and i ntegrated approach to 
managing transportation and public services.   With planning and implementati on support under DOT’s Smart City  grant, the project team will 
build on its existing regional lead ership in renewable-powered,  smart transit systems and 
services, to create a safer, more accessible, and optimized met ropolitan area. In this way, 
selection and deployment of the Canton Smart City Program (Prog ram or Project) will provide a 
flagship example for the red evelopment, reinvigoration, and gre ening of the Rust Belt, a region 
deeply in need of creative thin king, new ideas, and technologic al development. 
 SARTA and the City’s vision for t he Project seeks to deploy the  proposed Smart City system by 
carefully and thoughtfully interf acing with SARTA’s and the Cit y’s available assets and 
infrastructure. When complete, the Program will implement a Sma rt City system that is at once 
tailored to local needs, while  deploying advanced technologies and systems that provide several 
categories of key benefits in lin e with DOT goals. With a stron g focus on enhanced user 
experience, improved safety, and i ncreased transit and energy e fficiency, major facets of the 
Program will include:   
 Enhanced Connectivity. The Program will take major ste ps to integrate and coordinate 
existing modes of public and person al transit, extending curren t systems by deploying 
infrastructure-based sensors, data tracking and management, and  centralized information 
collection and management syste ms that will significantly enhan ce the quality of 
transportation service deliver y, while also facilitating expans ion into advanced coordination 
of delivery of goods and services. The Program will include a s trong focus on enhancing 
transportation opportunities among existing and proposed infrastructure, including the 
Akron-Canton Airport, the Cant on City core area, and the Profes sional Football Hall of Fame 
and proposed Hall of Fame Village.  
Figure 1:  The City of Canton maintains a rich and 
many-faceted history, and is the birthplace of the National Football League and the Professional Football 
Hall of Fame, which will soon  undergo renovation into 
an amusement park-style Hall of Fame Village. The 
Project promises to deliver $14.7 billion in cumulative 
net total economic output, w ith over 8,200 visitors/day.

SARTA Smart City Proposal Smart System Enabled Adaptability. The Program will deploy advanced data management 
algorithms to allow transit system s to adapt to changes in dema nd, changes in traffic 
conditions, and other conditions such as environmental changes,  ride-sharing, new forms of 
land-use, and multi-modal trip management to support adaptive s ystem management, 
enabling strong improvements t o efficient tran sportation.  
 Monitoring. Under the Program, SARTA’s and t he City’s transportation networ ks will be re-
envisioned to operate as a singl e entity, capable of being monitored, to provide real-time 
status regarding the performan ce and operation of all modes of transportation at any given 
time.  
 Energy and Environmental Enhancement.  The Program will enhan ce, support, and fit into 
SARTA’s existing and anticipate d deployments of advanced low-em ission and zero-emission 
vehicles, including the Midwest r egion’s first deployment of hydrogen fuel cell buses, 
helping to further advance the ag ency as the regional leader in  clean transit. The Program 
will also support the City’s broader plans to provide and devel op an integrated, 
environmentally sustainable, plea sant, and renewable-energy-bas ed living environment with 
upgraded smart infrastructure. 
 Key Infrastructure and Facilities. The Project will also include deployment of new key 
infrastructure and facilities targ eted at enhancing transit and  environmental/greening 
opportunities, including deploymen t of clean vehicle fleets, re newable energy systems, and 
updates to transit infrastructure. 
 
In total, the Program will strongly support DOT’s goals of enhancing mobility, improving safety, and addressing environmental concerns by reducing environmental footprints and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The team will meet these goals by deploying a Smart City system that focuses on a balanced portfolio of technology vision elements (Advanced and Connected Vehicles, Smart Energy, Intelligent Sensor-Based Infrastructure, and Back-Office Infrastructure), smart city vision elements (Smart City Data Collection and Management, Smart Land-Use Management, and Smart Parking), and innovative approaches to urban transportation (Advanced Urban Analytics, Connected and Involved Citizens, Advanced Logistics Management, and User Experience Management).

SARTA Smart City ProposalAs shown in Table 1, the Canton Urb anized Area makes an ideal location for the proposed Smart 
Cities initiative. The Project would make a significant improve ment to local transportation 
optimization, renewable energy, a nd city livabil ity, while also  providing strong support to the 
area’s existing touris t industry. The project lends strong supp ort to a significant planned 
expansion of the NFL Hall of Fame to encompass a theme-park lik e experience, which is 
expected to generate $14.7 billi on in cumulative net economic b enefit, bringing in 8,200 people 
per day to the Canton area. B y interfacing with and supporting the Hall of Fame Village Project 
with smart city and smart transit  systems, the Project will strongly support local economic 
development and tourism, while enabling showcasing of the proposed smart city systems and 
technologies to hundreds of thous ands of visitors to the City e ach year in an unexpected yet 
pivotal location: a historic Rust  Belt city fighting to revital ize and serve as a regional example of 
successful economic development , advanced service, and environm ental sustainability.

1.0 Canton Area Smart City Vision 
1.1 Key Challenges Facing the Canton Area 
Despite its rich history and statu s as the county seat of Stark  County, Canton faces several 
critical challenges, many of whi ch are typical of Rust Belt cit ies. Sluggish economic 
development has been perhaps the most central, long-term challenge for the City. While Canton 
is making meaningful progress to ward recovery from a decades-lo ng urban decline (1960s 
through the 1990s), the City and s urrounding areas have still s truggled to hold up what is left of 
their once-vital manufacturing ba se. For example, leading vacuu m maker Hoover recently 
announced closure of its last re maining facility in North Canto n, representing the final step in the 
company’s withdrawal from its birthplace, where the upright vac uum cleaner was first 
manufactured. Other key challenge s largely relate to the long-t erm loss of industry and resulting 
2/4/2016

SARTA Smart City Proposalchanges in population dynamics and city infrastructure. Populat ion in the City proper peaked in 
the 1950s at approximately 117,000, but has declined by 2% to 1 5% each decade since. This has 
resulted in several unique challenges, including excess but dec lining infrastructure, low road 
capacities, and urban center 
decay, including loss of retail enterprises. The City has also faced  planning challenges while trying to support economic development, including growth of urban sprawl, and the razing of many historic structures and closing of services.  
1.2 Proposed Smart City 
Elements Will Address Key Challenges 
The Project will provide 
support to mitigating several of t he Project team’s key challenges. The Project will directly and 
strongly address what is likely the most critical challenge fac ed by the Project team – limited 
and/or sluggish economic developm ent. The Project will carefull y integrate with planned 
facilities and operations  of the (separatel y proposed) Hall of Fame Village expansion project, 
which is expected to draw ove r 8,200 visitors per day, on avera ge, to the City. The Project will 
provide transportation support and s mart infrastructure designe d to minimize travel burdens for 
Hall of Fame Village visitors, whi le also helping to link the p roposed Village with retail centers 
and other attractions located in the City (National First Ladie s Library, McKinley Presidential 
Museum and Monument, downtown shops  and hotels, etc.). The Proj ect will also support other 
efforts by the City to revitali ze its downtown core, making tra nsit throughout the City easier, 
more accessible, and safer for all parties involved. Outside of Canton, the Project will further 
support the availability of services to underserved populations, support connectivity among 
Project Area communities, thereby supporting economic developme nt and  
revitalization across the Project Area, and also ease of transp ortation, making the Project a model 
within the region for smart city deployment and implementation.  
 
1.3 Approach to Implementing and Operating the Demonstration Pr oject 
SARTA (the Applicant) and the City will work closely with CalSt art together as team leaders to 
design and implement the Program. While SARTA working with CalS tart will ultimately be 
responsible for overall grant administration ( see Section 1.4),  SARTA and the City will lead and 
coordinate partner agencies/ technology providers during Program  development and deployment, 
with strong project management support provided by CalStart. Ca lStart will also provide the key 
function of measuring the success of the Project. During an ini tial planning phase, SARTA and 
the City will work with other team partners to design the overa ll Project. Other team partners 
will carry responsibility for technical and integration aspects  of the Project, according to their 
areas of specialty and/or needs . During Project operation, SART A, CalStart, and the City will 
oversee and be responsib le for all smart city functionality, equipment, and infrastructure within 
2/4/2016
5 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposaltheir purview. Other team member s – for example the Akron Canto n Airport – may retain 
responsibility for limited functions within the smart city Program (i.e., on site data collection), 
within the Project’s overarch ing collaborative framework. 
 
1.4 Program Management Approach 
The project will deploy a colla borative Program management appr oach, led by the Applicant, 
SARTA, working in close colla boration with the City of Canton, CalStart, and other Project 
partners. As an experienced man ager of federal grant funding, S ARTA boasts a strong 
background in grant program administration and implementation, with experienced staff and 
administration. SARTA also maint ains a large geographic reach, which includes the entire urban 
area considered under the Program. Thus, SARTA will draw on its  experience and geographic 
location as the ultimate administrator of the Program during th e Program during both the 
planning and implementation phases . During the initial planning /Program development phase of 
the Project, SARTA’s management team will work closely with Cit y leadership and other team 
members to plan the proposed P rogram, finalize proposed design,  and identify an 
implementation strategy for the Canton Smart City Program. Duri ng the deployment phase, 
SARTA and the City will collect ively manage and oversee transpo rtation and urban area 
infrastructure/management aspect s of the Program, respectively.  This structure will allow the 
team members to focus on their s trengths: SARTA on deployment of transit oriented Program 
components, and the City on urba n planning, traffic, and other urban-specific project aspects.  
 
2.0 Canton Area Population Characteristics 
The Canton Urbanized Area (Progr am Area) meets all conditions required by DOT in support of 
this application. Bas ed on Census-designated place population f igures from the 2010 census, the 
total population of the Program  Area was 279,245, of which the City of Canton accounted for 
73,007, or 26% of the total populatio n in the Program Area. The  Program Area includes 100% of 
the local urbanized area popul ation, as defined by DOT. Additio nally, the project area contains a 
dense urban core in the City of  Canton, as typical for a mid-sized urban area in the US Midwest. 
SARTA maintains an existing public transportation system, which  serves the entire Program 
Area (see Section 3.1 for additional detail).  
 
3.0 Canton Infrastructure and Planning Elements 
3.1 SARTA’s Existing Public Transit System 
SARTA maintains an extensi ve transit network that 
provides over 2.8 million rides each year in Stark 
County, Ohio. SARTA curre ntly operates 34 fixed 
routes in Alliance, Akron, Canton, Cleveland, Hartville, Jackson Townshi p, Louisville, Massillon, 
North Canton and Uniontown, with 79% of Stark County’s population livi ng within one-half mile of 
one of SARTA’s fixed rout es. In order to provide 
reliable service to as many as possible in Stark County, these fixed routes opera te over 20 hours and more than 7,500 miles each day, Monday 
through Saturday.  SARTA also depl oys the special Proline program, targeted at individuals with 
Figure 3 : SARTA Hydrogen  Fuel Cell Bus 
Prototype.
2/4/2016
6 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposaldisabilities, who are unable to u tilize SARTA’s normal fixed-route system. This countywide 
service picks residents up at their residence (or required orig in) and delivers them to their desired 
destinations. It is a crucial se rvice for thousands of disabled  individuals across Stark County. The 
organization also operates MedLine - non-medical transportation for eligible Medicaid Waiver 
holders, available through the Board of Development Disabilities, supporting employment, adult day support, and vocational training only.   As the Midwest’s budding leader in the demonstration and deployment of efficient, clean 
vehicles and renewable energy technology, SARTA is actively see king out and engaging 
advanced and environmentally fri endly transit vehicle technolog ies. As recently as 2012, 
SARTA did not own a single low- or  zero-emission transit vehicl e. Today, SARTA’s fleet of 100 
vehicles includes 40 converted low-emission compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered transit 
buses and four low-emission diesel-electric hybri d transit buses. SARTA has also committed 
funding (totaling nearly $20 million) for 7 new hydrogen fuel c ell buses, which will be deployed 
into fee service during 2016 and 2017. This growth in the fleet ’s low-emission vehicles 
represents SARTA’s commitment to moving its entire fleet to low - and zero-emission vehicles 
through conversion and new vehicle acquisitions as existing die sel vehicles reach the end of their 
lifespans. In the near term, S ARTA anticipates retaining only 2 5 diesel-powered transit buses, 
with the ultimate goal of a m ostly zero-emissions fleet. 
 
3.2 Amenability of the Area to Smart City Demonstration 
SARTA and the City are highl y amenable to Smart City 
demonstration and deployment. In a ddition to its commitment to 
environmental stewardship, SARTA  as an agency actively supports  
deployment of smart systems and technologies within its service 
area. The agency has made a strong and growing commitment to 
deploying advanced data management and user interface systems 
within its existing transit infrastructure and transit operatio ns. Since 
2010, SARTA has implemented a suite  of advanced data collection  
and management tools designed to o ptimize transit efficiency an d 
enhance rider experience. These  include: (1) PinPoint, a GPS 
system that enables riders to pr ecisely estimate when fixed rou te 
buses will arrive at a given location; (2) GoLine, an online tr ip 
booking system used to book and opt imize booking and routes for 
Proline trips; (3) Google Tran sit Interface, an online trip pla nning 
system for SARTA’s fixed route services that helps users to 
optimize their route and tell passengers when buses will pick them up with 10 minutes; (4) System Map , which shows all of SARTA’s 
fixed routes and their interconne ction points; and (5) Travel 
Training, which trains riders how  to most effectively use SARTA, how to read schedules, and 
how to use PinPoint. With the Pro ject, SARTA is looking to expa nd on its existing experience 
with deploying smart technology to o ptimize transit systems and  support enhanced user services. 
SARTA’s efforts under the Proj ect will build on existing infras tructure and data m
anagement 
systems, enabling an easy trans ition to the further deployment of smart city systems and 
technologies.   
Figure 4 . SARTA’s existing 
PinPoint GPS system allows 
riders to get a precise estimate of 
bus arrival within its service area.

SARTA Smart City ProposalThe City of Canton is also we ll-positioned to deploy new smart city technology to enhance 
transit, livability, and safety within the proposed Smart City Component areas. The City is, for 
the first time in 50 years, in t he process of updating its Comprehensive Plan. This anticipated 
update will provide a new framewo rk for the advancement of smar t technologies and smart city 
systems as proposed under the Project. Additionally, Canton’s p lanning staff and officials 
acknowledge the major potential economic, livability, safety, a nd environmental benefits of the 
Project, and strongly support de ployment of the proposed Smart City system within the City. 
 
 3.3 Leadership Commitment and Capacity 
As discussed in Section 3.2, SARTA and City leadership have sho wn a strong and continued 
commitment, including at the lead ership level, to deployment of  smart city systems and 
technologies; the Project will act as a natural extension and e xpansion of these exi sting activities, 
which SARTA and the City strongly embrace and commit to as a me ans to support economic 
growth, livability, safety, and service within the Program Area .  
 
With respect to capacity, SARTA and CalStart maintain administr ative staff with strong 
experience in grant administration and successful grant managem ent. If awarded, SARTA and 
CalStart will allocate experienced staff time to the administra tion, management, and deployment 
of the proposed Canton Smart City Program, and commit to supple menting existing staff with 
training and/or new hires as n eeded to design and deploy the Program. The City of Canton also 
maintains extensive experience  in grant program management and implementation, and has 
deployed a number of grants thr ough the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, as 
well as other housing-oriented bloc k grants. If awarded, the Ci ty will allocate staff with existing 
experience in grant program management and implementation. Similar to SARTA, the City commits to training staff and/or  making new hires needed to des ign and implement the Program. 
 
3.4 Sharing Economy Integration 
The Project team acknowledges significant potential benefits as sociated with the burgeoning 
sharing economy in the United Sta tes. From streamlined and redu ced cost transportation to peer-
to-peer based sharing of goods and access to services, sharing economies can produce significant 
benefits for participants by reducing the costs and economic bu rden associated with the purchase 
of goods and services. Sharing economy integration in support o f the Project will focus on 
transit-oriented services, namely data management and services to enable and facilitate 
ridesharing within the Program Area. Specific facets and implementation schemes for sharing economy integration will be investigated during the Project pla nning phase. Efforts will focus on 
improving and optimizing ridesharing opportunities, with a seco ndary focus on the transport and 
delivery of goods within the Concentrated Smart Vehicle Data an d Communication Area.  
 
3.5 Data Accessibility 
Led by SARTA and the City, the Project team is deeply committed  to supporting data 
accessibility and availability for appropriate use, while also maintaining user and personal and 
corporate privacy and safety as a pplicable. The Project team wi ll share data internally as needed 
to deploy all proposed elements of  the Program
. Where appropria te, the Project team will also 
consider making data availabl e, upon request, to outside public  and private entities, where doing 
so would not expose proprietary information (for example as mai ntained by the United Parcel

the Applicant will work with the remainder of the Project team and US DOT to de velop a series 
of guidelines to govern the sharing o f information collected during the course of Project 
deployment, also supporting open source ridesharing programs. 
 
4.0 Preliminary Site Map 
The project team has completed a Preliminary Site Map, which summarizes existing transit facilities operated by SARTA; points of interest that would be included in the proposed Smart 
City deployment; a Concentrated S mart Vehicle Data and Communic ation Area, where many 
facets of the Project would be deployed; and key proposed Program elements that would be deployed by the Project team. 
Figure 6: Vision Overview   
 
5.2 Technology Vision Elements 
Data Management Centers  
Data management systems will prov ide the operational heart of the proposed smart city function 
and operation. As shown in Figure  6, the proposed data manageme nt centers will include a 
System Master Controller (SMC) , a Traffic Master Controller (TM C), and an Energy Master 
Controller (EMC). 
 
2/4/2016
10 of 74
SARTA Smart City ProposalThe SMC is a supervisory controlle r that will coordinate the wo rk of the TMC and the EMC to 
manage both the transit and energy flows in the system in the best possible way. Data will be 
analyzed from the system to pred ict how to best configure both the movement of people and 
goods, and the movement of energy, s o that the renewable energy  that is produced is utilized to 
its best advantage, and people and goods are moved in ways that are the safest, most sustainable, least costly, and most convenient.  The TMC will draw on data and feedback provided by the proposed  sensor/data collection 
system, via the SMC. It will impl ement advanced and flexible al gorithms designed to optimize 
the movement of vehicles within t he proposed smart city system.  It will interface with SARTA’s 
existing transit operations system, and will also provide feedb ack to other covered entities and 
operations, including interface with freight delivery and manag ement corporations, local 
businesses, ride sharing infra structures, and individual driver s and other indivi duals while they 
are utilizing the proposed smart city system.  The EMC will closely track and manage energy flows associated with the proposed microgrid system. The EMC will seek to conf igure the energy production (from the biodigester and solar 
array as applicable), energy storage (in the batteries on board  charging vehicles, and in the 
proposed battery storage syste m), and energy utilization in suc h a way that the production and 
utilization of renewable energy is maximized. The EMC will also  help to ensure that renewable 
energy in the form of hydrogen (H
2), natural gas (NG), and electri city is produced in sufficient 
quantities to meet the  needs of the SARTA’s transit vehicles, a nd that the maximum economic 
benefit is achieved from this system.  Back Office Infrastructure  
A big data and transportation data  analytics system will be dev eloped and deployed in terms of 
hardware and software. This syst em will have the capability to ingest data from the multiple 
sources, including existing sensors, new sensors, nontraditiona l data sources, and external 
systems. It will have massivel y parallel processing capability to be able to handle the large data 
set involved and be able to bri ng data together into a single d ata hub using an advanced data 
platform. A discovery tool will also be deployed that would ena ble trends and patterns and 
insights to be developed from a n integrated data set. These wil l all be linked through a unified 
data architecture to a data warehouse that will provide a long- term data storage facility. This will 
also be linked to and be coordinate d with the EMC that will be controlling the production of 
renewable NG, H 2 and electricity, as well as ene rgy storage and the interconnection of the smart 
grid with the utility grid.  Advanced, Connected, and Green Vehicles 
Over the course of the Project , the team will deploy a smart tr ansit system that will include a 
pilot fleet of advanced and conn ected vehicles, while also prov iding support for privately owned 
smart vehicles within SARTA’s service area. The proposed vehicl es and data collection systems 
will support SARTA’s existing transit system, while enabling en hanced functionality including 
transit management, ridesharing, and enhanced safety for commut ers, cyclists, and pedestrians. 
These vehicles will use dedicate d short-range communication tec hnologies, and will rely on 
existing and proposed sensory inf rastructure to deliver informa tion to drivers and extract probe 
data from enabled vehicles. The proposed vehicles will all empl oy vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),

SARTA Smart City Proposalvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2 I), accident avoidance, and green driving aid technologies. Green 
driving aids will assess traffic conditions and the status of t raffic signals, and interface with the 
TMC to implement algorithms and vehicle management strategies t hat will minimize fuel  
consumption. Green driving advice  will be displayed for drivers in a simple format, such as a 
green light to speed up, or a red  light to coast, along with al ternate route suggestions designed to  
minimize bottlenecks. 
 The Project will also seek to de ploy additional advanced, clean vehicles and transit systems to 
support City operations. The City is looking to develop its own  fleet of clean, low GHG 
emission, CNG vehicles, and would use the project as starting p oint for development of that 
fleet. Other potential infrastructure to be considered will inc lude smart-design oriented facilities 
and equipment that would directl y support the Proj ect’s goals a s discussed in Section 11. For 
example, the Project will also a dd new SARTA service lines betw een the Airport, downtown 
Canton, and the proposed Hall of F ame Village, to provide enhan ced user support/transit 
opportunities and to support develo pment of the Hall of Fame Vi llage Project. Additional 
proposed SARTA bus lines are als o shown on the Project map (Figure 5) 
 Autonomous Vehicles  
In addition to the proposed smart t ransit system, the Project w ill deploy an autonomous vehicle 
loop (Figure 7) that will include several of the Program Area’s  main attractions, including the 
Akron-Canton Airport, the Belden V illage Commercial Area, the Professional Football Hall of 
Fame Village, Kent State Universi ty, and Stark State College, w hile also providing access to

SARTA Smart City ProposalCanton’s downtown core area. These autonomous vehicles will be 12-passenger, ba ttery electric 
vehicles that SARTA will opera te along fixed routes on Park Dri ve, along an existing greenway. 
When not in use, these autonomous v ehicles will be connected to  the proposed smart-grid to 
support charging as well as gri d energy storage functionality. Charging versus storage 
functionality will be determined adaptively by the proposed TMC  and EMC systems, wherein 
the latter will manage renewable energy production and the smar t grid system. All proposed 
autonomous vehicles would be batter y electric, with charging stations open to the public. 
 
Zero-Emission and Low-Emission Vehicles 
 The proposed smart transit system will make optimal use of zero - and low-emission vehicles by 
building on SARTA’s fleet of 7 adv anced hydrogen fuel cell buse s (currently ordered with 
delivery to be completed by the  end of 2017), plus 13 additiona l hydrogen fuel cell buses that 
will collectively represent one t hird of SARTA’s bus fleet. Additional vans used in ridesharing in 
support of the Project will be de ployed as CNG or battery elect ric vehicles, depending on the 
required duty cycle. Preliminary e stimates completed by SARTA indicate that approximately one 
third of the ride sharing vans n eeded for the Project will be b attery electric, and one third will be 
CNG-fueled. All proposed autonom ous vehicles would be battery e lectric. 
 Smart Energy (Renewable Energy, GHG Reduction)  
SARTA and the City collectively m aintain several key infrastructure elements that, under the 
Project, will be deployed to s upport renewable energy productio n and smart energy generation 
and management. The City’s existing, screen/membrane based sewage treatment facility currently collects and disposes of  solid wastes from incoming f lows. The City proposes to deploy 
a bio-digester system to utilize biosolids and other available organic feedstocks, via anaerobic 
digestion, to produce renewable natural gas (RNG). Once produced, RNG will be cleaned and 
used for at least one of the fo llowing purposes: (1) to be furt her cleaned and compressed for use 
as CNG in SARTA’s existing fleet  of CNG-fueled transit vehicles ; or (2) to be routed to a high 
temperature molten carbonate fuel cell,
1 thereby generating generate ele ctricity used to power the 
proposed smart grid and associated  loads (see below regarding smart grid deployment), hydrogen 
for use as fuel for SARTA’s growing fleet of hydrogen fuel cell  buses, and waste heat to support 
wastewater treatment and/or other processes. In this way, the p roject will sharpl y reduce existing 
GHG emissions associated with the  consumption of fossil fuel th at SARTA currently uses to fuel 
its CNG and remaining diesel-fueled buses, by offsetting heat e nergy consumed during the 
wastewater treatment process and by reducing grid demand for lo ads to be attached to the 
proposed smart grid. The proposed digester will be located at o r adjacent to the  existing Canton 
sewage treatment facility.  
 Intelligent Sensor-Based Infrastructure 
Building on the Canton Urbanized Area’s base of extensive infrastructure-based sensors, this element will plan, design and depl oy new intelligent sensors th at will work in combination with 
existing sensors, while also interfacing with innovative crowdsourcing and motion analytics data collection techniques. The proposed intelligent sensor systems will be deployed in clusters

SARTA Smart City Proposalaround modal interchanges, and als o dispersed in areas where ex isting gaps in sen sor networks 
currently limit data collection efforts.  
 Advanced Traffic Management  
The City’s current/existing advanced traffic management initiat ive will be extended to include 
additional major corridors of de mand that extend from the Akron -Canton airport to downtown 
Canton and associated hotels and commercial areas. This will in clude the deployment of 
adaptive, coordinated traffic si gnal control technology along w ith advanced sensors. Data will be 
used to manage the timing of smart signals, and will also be li nked into the Project’s Data 
Management Centers to support pe rformance management of the ent ire trip chain.  
  
5.2 Smart City Vision Elements 
Smart City Data: Sources  
The Project will rely on several key data sources to support th e proposed systems. These will 
include: (1) Reliance on SARTA’ s and the City’s existing data acquisition systems and 
infrastructure, as described in Section 9.0, as well as new dat a sources including (1) 
crowdsourcing (i.e., via smartphone s); (2) infrastructure senso rs; (3) probe vehicles; and (4) 
motion analytics. The Project will use these data, via the 
proposed data management cen ters and other applicable 
infrastructure, to meet the intended goals and objectives of the Project. If warranted, during the design phase of the Project, the team may elect to substitute or deploy additional data sources.  Smart City Data Collection and Management: Mode 
Specific and Interchange Data Collection 
The Project will incorporate mode-specific data collection serv ices in order to optimize 
transportation performance as w ell as information service delivery. The Project will address, at 
minimum, the modes shown in Tab le 3. Data will also be collecte d at key trans it interchanges 
(Figure 6), to support optimizati on of transit systems while interfacing with ridesharing and other 
proposed elements.   Smart Land-Use Management 
Land use has a significant imp act on the demand for transportat ion, the ability to effectively and 
efficiently satisfy that demand, and on the livability of an ur ban environment. The City is in the 
process of updating its Comprehen sive Plan for the first time i n roughly 50 years. In the interim, 
while attempting to attract economic development, City planners  permitted development of large 
areas of land with limited overs ight – as urban sprawl. The Cit y now recognizes critical benefits 
associated with smart land-us e management, including support for a blossoming urban corridor, 
as well as potential for inter face with other City goals, including deployment of green and smart 
technologies and systems. The planning process for the Project is expected to generate significant input and insight int o how land use interplays with  transportation demand. To best 
take advantage of this unique opportunity, the City proposes to  cross-pollinate Project design Private Car Uber/Equ ivalent Ridesharing

SARTA Smart City Proposalphase activities with the City’s Comprehensive Plan update, ena bling smart city-oriented goals, 
objectives, and policies to be depl oyed within the City’s regular planning outlook.  
 
From a data collection and analy tics perspective, the proposed sensor-based and probe-based 
data collection system, combine d with Smart City analytics capability, will allow the City to 
identify new insights into how l and use affects transportation and city management. This 
information will help refine SARTA’s and the City’s future goal s, beyond the Project, with 
respect to smart city planning a nd urban development. It will a lso empower the City and other 
cities in the region to define smart land-use policies that pro vide multiple benefits, including 
close interface with transporta tion infrastructure and optimization of service delivery. Ultimately, 
through efficient information connectivity proposed under the P roject, the City will leverage its 
mobility hubs to provide better connectivity and a richer user experience overall, for both 
residents and visitors.  Smart Parking 
The Project team will plan and de ploy a smart parking system wi thin the Canton downtown area. 
The proposed system will have event management capabilities, sm art payment capabilities, and 
will provide a revenue managem ent suite for pa rking operations. Smart parking will also support 
variable parking fees. Briefly, the system will deploy sensors as needed to evaluate parking 
demand in real time, and adjust price accordingly. Price adjust ments could be made for the sole 
purpose of optimizing revenue, or  also to encourage people to u se alternate parking infrastructure 
during times of congestion.   
5.3 Innovative Approaches to Urban Transportation Elements 
Advanced Urban Analytics 
The Project team recognizes tha t a much larger amount of data i s now available regarding 
current operating conditions on the  existing tran sportation net work than is effectively utilized by 
the City or by the applicant. The cost of sensors has been redu ced and the availability of 
crowdsourcing techniques, such a s motion analytics and sentimen t analysis of social media, is 
providing transporta tion practitioners with unparalleled insight. The impending tidal wave of 
connected vehicle data adds to this richness while providing ch allenges and opportunities for 
integration into smart city systems. 
 To get the very best from this new availability of data it will  be necessary for a Smart City to 
adopt best-of-breed big data and da ta analytics techniques. This will involve going beyond data 
measurement and reporting into be havioral and predictive analyt ics, collaborative ideation, and, 
eventually, development of a “sentient city,” all of which illu strate the underlying mechanisms 
affecting transportation performance. The Project will facilitate big data utilizati on and analytics 
through its proposed Integrated D ata Warehouse and Unified Data Architecture systems (refer to 
Section 9.2), which will be deployed in coordination with the p roposed SMC, TMC, and EMC.   
 Traffic Management Initiative 
A proposed traffic management initiative will expand on Canton’ s existing traffic management 
initiative, by providing sophisticat ed traffic controllers link ed by telecommunications to the 
central TMC. These roadside devi ces will be capable of managing  traffic signal timings, 
2/4/2016
15 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalcollecting traffic data and collecting data from smart devices and other data sources. This will be 
extended to include major corri dors of demand from the airport to downtown Canton and hotels. 
The system will also include deployment of adaptive, coordinate d traffic signal control 
technology and advanced sensors t o enable the collection of dat a to drive smart traffic signal 
timing. This system will also be expected to provide a feed int o the data management system for 
overall performance manageme nt of the whole trip chain. 
 
Information Services and Management  
 Mode specific information services deployed under the Project w ill provide real-time decision 
quality input and choices to travelers in a context-sensitive m anner. Utilizing physical and 
computing infrastructure propose d under the SMC and TMC, the proposed context-sensitive 
system will take account of current mode of travel, location, and other conditions that affect travel. On modes within the tot al trip chain, information servi ces will be delivered to enhance the 
user experience and provide deci sion quality inp ut to the trave ler. It is expected that these will 
include, at minimum, the following:  
 User engagement to involve users in  the smart city system at th e outset of a trip, and to 
continue to contribute user-gen erated content (including reviews, helpful tips for fellow 
travelers, feedback on local busin esses and services, etc.) thr ough the end of their trips;  
 Opportunities to engage ser vice providers in dialogue; 
 Location- and mode-specific services; 
 Travel information including cos t of travel, timing, reliabilit y, and optional modes and 
routes; 
 Travel time on current mode and options. 
 
At interchange nodes wi thin the total trip chain, information s ervices will be delivered to 
enhance the user experience and pr ovide decision quality input to the traveler. It is expected that 
functionality at service nodes will include similar services to  those identified for mode specific 
information, above.  Smart Grid 
As shown in Figure 6, the Project  will deploy an integrated sma rt grid, which will build on 
SARTA’s and the City’s existing infrastructure, and existing ad vanced, energy-efficient transit 
systems. The proposed anaerobic bi o-digester, located at the Ci ty’s existing sewage plant, will be 
the primary source of renewable  energy to the smart grid, which  would also include utility grid 
power connection, an optional so lar array having a capacity in the hundreds of kilowatts, and 
optional battery storage. The smart grid will connect these pow er sources to the existing sewage 
plant, to the recharging station f or the battery electric auton omous vehicles, and to ridesharing 
service vans. Hydrogen from the proposed fuel cell (see prior d iscussion) will be transported, via 
pipe, to SARTA’s hydrogen fueling st ation, while refined renewa ble CNG will be compressed 
and deployed at SARTA’s existing CNG fueling stations.   Smart grid functionality will allo w the proposed battery-electr ic vehicle charging center to use 
charging electric vehicles as a temporary source of power, whic h would be sent back onto the 
2/4/2016
16 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalsmart-grid during periods of  high utility demand. The smart gri d will have a control system (the 
EMC, described above), which will configure the energy producti on, storage (in compressed 
hydrogen, CNG, and optional batteri es both on the smart-grid an d in the charging battery electric 
vehicles), and energy exchanged on the utility grid, so as to m aximize the benefit to the transit 
system. The EMC will coordinate closely with the TMC and weathe r and traffic predictions to 
develop a strategy for energy pr oduction, storage, and exchange  with the utility grid. 
 
Connected, Involved Citizens 
Recent statistics show that more than 90% of people have access  to a cell phone and that more 
than 60% of the cell phones are capable of operating as a smart phone. For example, it is possible to purchase a track phone from Wal mart for $10 with full voice, text and Internet access 
capabilities. It is becoming obvi ous that the cell phone and a smart phone are becoming powerful 
tools in connecting and involving citizens. It is expected that  the Project will feature extensive 
use of these devices for both information delivery and for prob e data collection techniques in 
order to gain a detailed unders tanding of people movements and the use of the various modes 
within the multimodal travel cha in. It is also expected that ci tizen and visitor sentiment with 
regard to their transportation experiences will be measured on a continuous basis using the same 
devices.  Advanced Logistics Management  
A significant proportion of urba n transportation demand is generated by the need to move goods 
around the City. An efficient smart city will be able to sense and understand the ebb and flow of 
freight delivery and logistics de mand and provide insight in how to optimize this element of 
transportation. The Project will partner with private companies , including UPS and FedEx, and 
possibly other service providers s uch as the US Postal Service (USPS).  Facilitating urban 
delivery and logistics means a ddressing and even anticipating the bottlenecks and pinch points in 
the current system, something t hat can be better  understood in terms of the related data. An urban 
freight delivery project will be conducted in close association  with FedEx and UPS. The 
objectives of the urban freight  delivery project will be to take full advantage of new data, 
combined with data available f rom FedEx and UPS, and to make use of the analytics capability 
of the back office infrastructure . This project will result in new insights into optimum routing 
and timing for the routes take n by urban freight delivery and Utica shale support vehicles. 
 Smart Apps and Crowdsourcing  
An expanded range of smart apps will be developed to provide en hanced basic services and pay-
as-you-go premium services (i.e ., initially focusing on parking  and transportation services, with 
potential for expansion to othe r services over time), as well a s services to reach out to the 
underserved. The proposed smart apps will interface with and/or  expand on SARTA’s existing 
suite of transit oriented apps, a nd will also support social sentiment analysis to de termine traveler 
satisfaction on a continuous basis. The proposed data managemen t system (see prior discussion) 
design and interface will explicit ly consider the requirements of smart phone app developers 
with respect to ease of acce ssing a logical data hub on which t o build their services. The apps 
will also help to link the underserved with aid groups such as foundations helping specific 
portions of the underserved commu nity, as well as public aid. S mart apps will also be 
2/4/2016
17 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalincorporated into crowdsourcing da ta collection efforts, to hel p acquire critical data related to 
current mode of travel and current travel conditions.   
 User Experience Management 
A specific focus will be placed on the use of data and analytic s and the new understanding of the 
total trip chain to optimize user  experience through a variety of management techniques. It is 
expected that these management  techniques will use information delivery via smart phone and 
other information display devices , connected vehicle technology and will address both the 
rectification and mitigati on of associated issues.  
 
6.0 Risks and Risk Management 
The team has designed the Project to minimize risk as practicab le. Nonetheless, some degree of 
risk is unavoidable. Key areas  of risk include technical risk, policy risk, and institutional risks 
associated with deployment of the proposed Project/vision.  
 
Technical risks of the Project can be broken int o two primary categories: risk s associated with 
reliance on and interfacing with e xisting infrastructure (exist ing tech risks), and risks associated 
with the proposed infrastructur e and systems/operations (potential tech risks). Existing tech risks 
stem from the proposed relian ce on systems that may be founded on older standards or older 
infrastructure, and which may not  be fully compatible with the proposed system. Based on a 
preliminary review of available infrastructure, the Project tea m anticipates that these types of risk 
will be limited. SARTA’s existing da ta management, tracking, an d clean energy equipment and 
systems are up-to-date, fully f unctional, and are expected to b e compatible with the proposed 
infrastructure and systems. The Project team will further minimize risk by completing a compatibility review for all existing and proposed systems duri ng the Project design phase. The 
City’s data systems are somewha t older, but are expected to mai ntain interface capability with 
Teradata’s proposed systems ( see Section 7, below). Potential t ech risks are related to the 
potential for failure of propose d systems due to deficiencies o r inadequacies in the proposed 
equipment, or improper planning a nd deployment of the proposed equipment. The Project will 
minimize these potential risks through continued reliance on co mmercially available and 
tested/proven infrastructure and data collection and management systems. Additionally, the team 
will vet all proposed technologies during the design phase.  
 
Policy risks relevant to the Project are limited. Ohio does not presently ma intain restrictions or 
guidance on the deployment of unm anned vehicles, as is the case  in some states. City and 
SARTA policy are considered favorable to deployment of the Proj ect, which is strongly in line 
with the goals and objectives pr oposed under SARTA’s current 5- year plan. City policies and 
planning are currently under revi sion (under a separate initiative), and the City plans to use the 
design phase of the Project to ful ly evaluate and update City p olicies to ensure compatibility with 
the proposed Project, as warrante d. Where unanticipated conflic ts or deficiencies in policy are 
identified for SARTA or the C ity, both entities are committed to deploying the Project, and 
would work quickly to alleviate such issues.   
 
Institutional risks  for the Project team would als o be limited. The Project would align very 
closely with SARTA’s existing st rategic direction (as discussed  above and in Section 12.1), and 
2/4/2016
18 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalalso with the City’s charge to support economic development, sa fety, and environmental 
sustainability. The Project would not include elements that wou ld conflict with or interfere with 
institutional governance or manag ement. While the Project would  involve participation by 
universities (see Se ction 7.1), equipment and facilities would be deployed almost entirely off-
campus and without being owned or operated by a university, min imizing potential for 
institutional risks. Although ins titutional risks are anticipat ed to be minimal, the project would 
complete a thorough review of potential institutional risks dur ing the Project design phase, in 
order to ensure compatibility. A ny potential risks identified w ould be minimized in collaboration 
with DOT as warranted. 
 
7.0 Partnership 
 
7.1 Team Partners and Stakeholders 
The Project would involve a diverse team of public entities, pr ivate corporations, and 
university/research org anizations that woul d collaborate to des ign and deploy the proposed 
Project. Final roles of each project team member and partner wi ll be definitively finalized during 
the initial planning process. Nonetheless, the following list of partners and stakeholders provides 
an inventory of Project partici pants, while highlighting antici pated roles. Key team partners and 
stakeholders include:  SARTA 
As the local transit agency and lead applicant, SARTA will play  a 
significant role in the development and operation of the Progra m. 
SARTA maintains a long-term, forward-looking commitment to deploying smart systems, including smart and low/no emissi on vehicles, as well as intell igent interfaces designed to 
support ease of use/user convenience, system optimization, ener gy savings, and deployment of 
enhanced services to underserved communities. SARTA will also m ake available provide transit 
and other data that it collects under existing conditions, and under the proposed Project, for use 
by the proposed Data Management C enters. SARTA maintains a long -term commitment to 
deploying advanced transit technologies and systems, and is alr eady establishing itself as a leader 
and regional hub for the integra tion and deployment of clean tr ansit systems, having successfully 
won $8.9 million in prior federal grant funding in 2014. SARTA is currently pursuing additional 
grant funding from a number of  sources and strategic partnerships. Finally, SARTA is committed 
to providing outreach a nd services to the underrepresented. The  primary population that SARTA 
serves maintains an income of under $17,000 per year, and over half of SARTA’s ridership is of 
African-American descent. For more about SARTA’s existing trans it system, see Section 3.1. 
 City of Canton  
Canton maintains extensive experi ence in effectively administer ing, and 
rapidly and successfully deploying f ederal grant programs, including 
homeowner support programs thr ough the US Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD), as well as community development block grant and emergency solutions grant programs. Canton maintains a wide array of existing public services and infrastructure, described thr oughout this proposal, which it will bring to support the Project.

SARTA Smart City ProposalDuring the planning and deployment  phases of the Project, the C ity will work closely with 
SARTA to help manage developmen t and implementation of the Proj ect, while also coordinating 
internal resources and supporting outreach and collaboration wi th other Project partners.  
 
CalStart 
CalStart is a national strategic broker for the clean and smart transportation industry, dedicated to growth of a clean transportati on industry that will create high  quality economic opportunities, 
reduce GHG emissions, and support smart growth and infrastructu re development. CalStart 
oversees and manages tens of  millions of dollars in grant funds  each year, and will provide 
administration support and documentation of benefits/successes for the Project.  Ohio Department of Transportation (DOT) 
The Ohio DOT oversees transportat ion-related infrastructure 
within the state. Ohio DOT supports conventional automotive 
transit, as well as smart tra nsit solutions, including but not limited to enhancement of bicycling 
and other alternative transportation opportunitie s. As relevant  to the Project, the Ohio DOT is 
expected to play a significant advisory and regulatory role in all surface transportation elements 
of the Project. It is envisioned that Ohio DOT will also provid e traffic and other transportation 
data, which will be fed into the proposed data management syste m.  
 Akron-Canton Airport 
Akron-Canton Airport is a commerc ial airport serving the Projec t area and greater 
vicinity, located approximately 10 miles northwest of Canton. In operation since World War II, the airport currently serves primarily as a regio nal passenger 
airport. The Airport is in the  process of implementing a 10-yea r, $110-million 
Capital Improvement Plan, whic h will culminate in 2018. Akron-C anton Airport 
will be expected to provide data w ith regard to aircraft arriva ls and the flow of travelers to and 
from the airport, to support multi-modal travel management unde r the Project. The airport will 
also be expected to play an act ive role in the understanding an d enhancement of the user 
experience through the airpor t phase of user trips. 
 Ohio State University (OSU) and Additional Public Partners and Stakeholders 
The Ohio State University, Center for Automotive Research (OSU-CAR) is an acknowledged international expert in sustainable mobility, active since the 1970s. OSU-CAR will support ITS 
and will also contribute Big Data management, data sensors, dat a analytics, ride sharing, electric 
vehicles, and renewable energy deployment. Other public partner s and stakeholders include the 
Ohio State University, Kent Sta te University Stark, and Stark S tate College.   
 NFL Hall of Fame 
The NFL Hall of Fame is the fo cal tourist attra ction in the Cit y. The organization 
is currently in the process of pl anning a major expansion which , as discussed 
elsewhere in this proposal, will deploy an amusement-park-like Hall of Fame 
Village focused on providing in-person and interactive experien ces to incoming 
visitors on one centralized campus. As such, the Hall of Fame w ill require careful 
2/4/2016
20 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalplanning and integration with the  proposed smart city system, relying on public and private 
transit opportunities as well as parking services to support it s proposed use. Transportation will 
be a critical element for the Hall of Fame Village’s employees and visitors, and will play into 
visitors’ first experiences of  the updated Hall of Fame campus.  Within the Project the 
organization will be expected t o provide data and also play a significant role in enhancing the 
user experience. As a private sector organization it will also be expected that this partner will be 
seeking to identify ways to monetize the detailed understanding of the trip and to end user 
experience, to better support tourism at its facility and in th e region generally. 
 Airline Partners 
Willing airline partners will be solicited during the planning phase of the Project, for 
incorporation into the Project t eam. Airlines will be expected to provide data about aircraft 
schedules and status, as well as  the flow of travelers into and  out of the Canton system. The 
airlines will play an active role in the understanding and enha ncement of the user experience 
through the airline phase of the trip and through user reservation and related research.  Verizon  
Verizon will be expected to provide data plus communication inf rastructure 
required to collect probe data fr om both vehicles and pedestria ns, transmitting 
this data back to a central loc ation for use by the data management systems in 
support of the Project. The Project team may also work with Ver izon to acquire additional user 
location and other available data , as available and as needed i n support of the Project. As a 
private sector company, Verizon w ill also be expected to identi fy ways to monetize the new 
insights and information regar ding overall trip experience 
 Teradata  
Teradata is a global leader in t he deployment, analysis, and ut ilization of Big Data, specializing 
in deploying big data analytics , as well as data warehousing and integration with existing and 
proposed data sources. Teradata wi ll provide the primary smart city technology needed to 
integrate the proposed data sets from the various stages and el ements of the Project, through the 
overall end-to-end trip, and the ada ptive “sentient” capability  required of a smart city. Teradata 
will also provide the professional services required to extract , transform and load data into a 
central repository, and manage new big data resources that will  grow even during the duration of 
Program deployment. The company will also provide a total hardw are and software solution 
enabling the data to be manage d and analytics and discovery activities to be conducted on the 
integrated data set. During the  Project planning process, Terad ata will work closely with 
SARTA, the City, and other Projec t team members to design a fea sible and high-benefit smart 
city system, in line w ith DOT proposed benefits. 
 Freight Carriers 
The smart transit system will coordinate closely with freight c arriers such as UPS, FedEx, and 
USPS to ensure that goods, as we ll as people, can move through the system efficiently as well as 
safely. By coordinating human tri ps with the planned movement o f goods, all parties will benefit. 
Thus, freight carrier coopera tion is strongly supported, because the TMC will be able to provide 
guidance on how to effectively plan  trip deliveries. Human tran sit will benefit through being able 
2/4/2016
21 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalto coordinate and optimize trips with the movement of goods. In  addition, the movement of 
freight can garner some signal priority consideration (enhancing signal length when possible to 
aid delivery vehicles). Finally, f reight carriers can make excellent use of the full data set, 
applying their own analytics to determine better ways to comple te their individual missions.   
 
7.2 Demonstration Governance Process 
As the Project appli cant, SARTA will ultima tely be responsible for the implementation and 
success of the Project. However, the Project team recognizes th at each team member will carry 
explicit responsibility  in deploying the Pr oject. Chief among t hese, along with SARTA, is the 
City of Canton, which oversees d eployment and governance of all  non-SARTA facilities located 
within its boundary. One key stren gth of the Project is that it  will involve stakeholders; however, 
governance of shared resources ca n prove challenging. The Project’s structure carefully 
considers this potential challe nge in light of local conditions . SARTA already manages transit 
systems throughout the entire Pr oject area, thereby providing a cohesive governance entity for 
applicable facilities across the Project area. Remaining non-tr ansit facilities will remain under 
the control of the local agencies where applicable physical fac ilities and equipment are located, 
but shared status will be mai ntained through contractual agreem ents or equivalent, as applicable.  
 
7.3 Public and Private Partners hips and University Research 
Lead by SARTA and supported by the City, the Project will rely on extensive partnering among 
the proposed Project team, as shown above. During the Project d evelopment phase, team leaders 
will solicit input from all team  members to flesh out the detai ls of the proposed vision for the 
Project. University partners l isted above have already expresse d interest in collaborating as part 
of the Project team, or in an advi sory role in support of the P roject, and their rol es will be refined 
and more closely defined during the initial design phase. Movin g to deployment, SARTA and the 
City will also work closely with team members to develop specif ic partnership structures that

SARTA Smart City Proposalwill be deployed upon Project initi ation. If the Project is ult imately selected for deployment, the 
team will implement the proposed partnerships to collectively s upport deployment of the 
proposed Project. The team will also seek out opportunities to incorporate university research 
and/or learning opportuniti es where possible.  
 
8.0 Existing Transportation Infrastructure 
The Canton Urbanized Area (the Pro ject Area) maintains a total of 272 miles of arterials, 79.5 
miles of freeway, and a transit  service promulgated by SARTA that includes 34 fixed routes plus 
shared-use mobility services ( see Section 3.1 for additional de tail). SARTA maintains existing 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Intelligent Commun ication Technology (ICT), 
including transportation manageme nt centers and field equipment within its existing service area, 
supporting its existing operati ons, as discussed in Section 3.2 . There is no smart grid or electric 
vehicle charging infrastructure within the Program Area, althou gh SARTA is completing 
construction of an advance d hydrogen fueling station designed to support its fleet of advanced 
fuel cell buses, which will be deployed starting in late 2016.  
 
9.0 Available Data 
9.1 Data currently collected by SARTA and the City 
SARTA currently collects a subs tantial amount of real-time data  on its existing transit fleet and 
operations. SARTA uses these da ta to help commuters to use SARTA’s services more 
effectively, and also to provide  a means for internal tracking and optimization of SARTA 
systems and operation. Data collect ed by SARTA currently includ es real-time speed and location 
information for each transit vehicle in SARTA’s service; passen ger counts as they enter and exit 
buses; point-to-point vehicle tr acking; data col lected through automated phone user interfaces, 
which allow ride reservations through SARTA’s accessibility pro grams; bus scheduling 
information; and data that allo ws for optimization of pickup, d rop-off, and routes for 
accessibility services. The City currently collects data from i ts existing signalize d intersections.  
 
9.2 Data Sharing and Use, Candidate Data, and Cross-Cutting Par tnerships 
The Project team’s current data  collection, storage and analysi s functions are conducted on an 
agency-by-agency basis. This has created disjointed data silos,  reducing the potential for data 
sharing and collaboration among a gencies and potential smart city participants. Worse yet, 
because these data silos are created for use by individual agencies, data in the silos is 
transformed by standard business practices applicable to each. Where collaboration and data 
sharing is needed, for example to support multimodal travel, or development of mobility hubs that incorporate needs of urban f reight and logistics, these si los remain on the sidelines. In 
contrast, the Program will requi re flexibility to connect data at a level of detail that has been lost 
through agency specific practices.  Best-practices in data managemen t will center on the creation o f Integrated Data Warehouses 
(IDW), which will enable development of new data-driven service s by acting as a functional 
repository that allows query by any user at any time. Agency-specific business practices can be integrated into the IDW, and data  is stored only once while being available for use many times 
for different purposes. Under the Program, a logical IDW will s upport the collection and 
2/4/2016
23 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalverification of data from all so urces across the smart city inc luding sensor-based, probe-based 
and transit-vehicle-b ased data sources. It will enable data to be utilized from systems such as 
existing advanced traffic management and electronic payment sys tems, and also from 
nontraditional data sources beyond transportation, such as smart card transactions and smart 
electricity grid management systems.    The Unified Data Architecture (UDA) shown in Figure 8 is recognized by information 
technology analysts as best practi ce for enterprises that are centered on creating value from data, 
such as smart cities. The logi cal IDW acts as both a data hub and a data lake, providing the 
capability for all source data integration and the information distribution required by local 
transportation partners and pr ivate sector partners.  
  
Figure 8:  Proposed Data Manag ement Architecture 
 The proposed logical IDW/UDA syst em represents a critical advan cement in data management 
for the Project team, extendi ng far beyond the simple integrati on of data by providing a means 
for facilities and managers to capture and utilize unstructured data sources from the Internet of Things, as well as mobile and consumer/commercial Internet appl ications. Within the proposed 
architecture, the proposed data platform supports the ingestion and verification of data from many sources, while allowing disc overy of trends and patterns i n the data and analytics to guide 
planning, Project delivery, and ope rations and maintenance for the smart city. Collectively the 
UDA system will provide a secure, coherent framework for integrating data and dis tributing data 
with one logical data infrastruc ture, the UDA will provide a framework for maximizing the 
utility of data collected in support of the Project, including supporting key goals of improved 
safety, efficiency, or customer e xperience using real-time data analytics techni ques to provide  
fast insights and management flexibility. Additionally, the pro posed integrated system will break 
down existing barriers among team p artners by enabling cohesive  use of the system, replacing 
current individual and disjointe d data management systems. The proposed system will strongly 
2/4/2016
24 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalfacilitate cross-cutting partner ships in support of data sharing, primarily between the City and 
SARTA, but also among project team  members including universiti es and private  partnerships. 
  
9.3 Data Integration  
The proposed logical IDW/UDA described above will facilitate da ta use for variety of 
applications under the Project. U ltimate details regarding data  use and utility, in light of a new 
collaboration-oriented data management system, require planning level input from Project team 
partners, and will be determine d during the planning phase of t he Project. Nonetheless, the 
Project team anticipates that transit data will be used not only to optimize transportation systems 
under the Project, but also to de ploy safety measures and enhan ce services provided by SARTA 
and the City. Other data, includ ing crowdsourcing and other ava ilable data, would also be 
integrated into the proposed TMS, to further support Project go als.  
 
9.4 Policies 
The City does not currently maint ain Comprehensive Plan policie s relating to the collection, 
management, or sharing of data under the Project. Nonetheless, as described previously, the City 
is presently in the process of updating its milestone Comprehen sive Plan, providing opportunity 
to implement additional guideli nes and policies relevant to sup port smart city deployment.  
 
9.5 Candidate Data for Sharing 
Key targets for data sharing (i.e., candidate data) will focus primarily on transit-related data, 
which is relevant the City and S ARTA, as well as many of the ot her Project team members. 
Certain data subcategories, howev er, will remain proprietary. For example, sharing of parcel 
delivery and management data, whe re it overlays with or mimics data currently collected by UPS 
and other parcel delivery partne rs, may be restricted in order to protect proprietary information 
managed by those entities. Other candidates for data sharing wi ll include data used to support 
enhanced user safety, as we ll as energy management. 
 
9.6 Data Integrity, Sharing Procedure, and Policies 
The proposed Unified Data Archite cture will feature a defense-in-depth approach to information 
security. Combining this approac h with an integrated data wareh ouse (IDW) reduces the 
automatic dispersion of data stor age and minimizes unintentiona l release of data, while 
increasing the overall effectiven ess and managea bility of a com prehensive security program. 
When data is in an IDW, security efforts can be focused and eas ily monitored and maintained 
without the risk of weaknesses in  a single uncontrolled databas e exposing the entire enterprise 
environment to risk. Security fea tures will include: user-level  security controls, increased user 
authentication, support for security roles, enterprise directory, integration, network traffic 
encryption, and auditing and monitoring controls.  
10.0 ITS and Connected Vehicle Technologies 
10.1 Deployment Per Existing Sta ndards, Architectures, and Certification 
To harness the highest value fro m technologies, services, and products, the Project planning 
phase will include deve lopment of a framework that explains how  the various elements will fit 
together and will work together to achieve the objectives. This  will involve the development of a 
2/4/2016
25 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalsmart city architecture, supported by a capability maturity mod el that will provide details 
regarding Project implementati on and deployment. The framework will also define the standards 
to be incorporated into the Project. These will include connect ed vehicle standards that are 
currently developing f or transit signal pr iority, freight, and emergency vehicle applications. 
Current standards will be deploye d, including traffic managemen t data dictionary and the SAE 
J1708/J1587 standard for transit  vehicle area networks. Vehicle  safety applications that use V2V 
and V2I communications will make use of secure, wireless interf aces facilitated by DSRC. 
Standards that have already bee n identified that will be adopte d for DSRC elements include the 
IEEE 802.11p amendment for wireless access in vehicular environ ments (WAVE); the IEEE 
1609.2, 1609.3, and 1609.4 standards for Security, Network Serv ices and Multi-Channel 
Operation; the SAE J2735 Message S et Dictionary; and the emergi ng SAE J2945.1 
Communication Minimum Performance Requirements standard.  
 
 
Figure 9 : System Engineering and Planning Approach. 
 
The Project team recognizes that standards development activity  is dynamic, and that currently 
available standards for many smart city technologies and system s are fluid and still developing. 
One ongoing facet of the Project will be to review emerging and  available standards on a 
periodic basis, so that the late st versions may be incorporated  as relevant into further 
development of the proposed smart city elements, as relevant an d to the extent practicable.  
 All system engineering and planni ng associated with the project will be conducted in accordance 
with Federal Highway Admin istration rules 940.1 through 940.13 and Federal Transit 
Administration policy as published in the Federal Register: Jan uary 8, 2001 (volume 66, number 
5, pages 1455 to 1459). This will involve the application of a formal structured system 
engineering approach, making use of the process illustrated in Figure 9. The activities and work 
products defined therein will be resourced/developed as Project ’s system engineering approach.

10.2 Standards Improvement 
The Project team will document e xperiences with deploying the f rameworks identified under 
item 10.1 in support of the Project , as part of its reporting to the DOT under the Project. 
Reporting will identify any observed deficits in applicable sta ndards, to ultimately help industry 
and standards developers to define and/or refine existing and f uture standards. The Project team 
will focus on lessons learned while deploying applicable standa rds, especially those in the early 
phases of development. In additi on to providing this informatio n to DOT, the Project team will 
make this information available to standards developers upon re quest and approval.

While satisfying the above goals  and objectives, the Project wi ll also provide a world-class 
showcase opportunity that will take advantage of the presence o f hundreds of thousands of 
visitors to Canton every year, e xposing them to smart city tran sportation and management 
technology as well as providing s uperb service t o our citizens and businesses. 
 
12.0 Applicant and City Capacity for Project Deployment 
12.1 Executive Commitment 
The Project applicant has dem onstrated strong executive level c ommitment to the Project, and to 
deploying a Smart City within its service area, in collaboratio n with the proposed team. 
SARTA’s board has passed a resolution to submit this grant appl ication, and to wholly support 
the Project. Additiona lly, the Project represents a furthering of SARTA’s existing goals of 
developing data integrated trans it systems that safely serve un derprivileged and other citizens 
within its service area. Specifi cally, the Project would enable  SARTA to further enhance its key 
services, while also supporting d eployment of additional renewa ble energy use for transit, as 
well as other technologies and s ystems as proposed. SARTA aims to become the regional leader 
in clean transit, as well as service through smart systems depl oyment and implementation, and 
the Project would strongly suppor t SARTA’s goals and objectives, as defined within its Five 
Year Development Plan.2 Finally, SARTA has already rec eived an Ohio grant for coordination, 
and the organization is moving forward with a transit review fo r the Hall of Fame Village 
regardless of the outcome of this grant application. The City a lso strongly supports the Project at 
the executive level, and is in t he process of passing a resolut ion that will str ongly support the 
Project, including its initial  design phase, and its implementa tion, if the award is received.  
 
12.2 Workforce Capacity 
As the Applicant, SARTA maintai ns a strong commitment to deploying the project, including at 
the day-to-day management and implementation level. SARTA’s existing staff carry strong 
experience in grant management, deployment, and administration,  and maintain sufficient 
capacity to deploy the initial pl anning phase of the grant. If the deployment grant is awarded, 
SARTA plans to commit existi ng staff to deploying the Project, yet recognizes that additional 
                                                 
2 http://www.sartaonline.com/trans it-development-plan-tdp-2015  
2/4/2016
28 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalstaff may be needed in order to install and operate all aspects  of the Project. SARTA will assess 
the potential need for additional staff during the Project design phase, and will acquire additional 
staff, or retrain existing sta ff, as needed to support the Project. The City also maintains a strong 
commitment the project, and plans to commit staff with relevant engineering and design, 
leadership, and grant administration and deployment experience in support of the Project. Staff 
would be initially sourced from existing, qualified City resour ces. However, the City will also 
consider hiring additional, qualified staff as needed for deplo yment of the full Project, if 
awarded. The City will evaluate a vailable and anticipated staff ing needs during the design phase 
of the Project, and will incorporate additional hiring as warra nted if full funding is received. 
 
12.3 Infrastructure Readiness 
SARTA’s existing infrastructure  is discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, above. Briefly, SARTA 
maintains a fleet of 100 transit  vehicles, including 40 convert ed low-emission CNG vehicles, 
plus a minimum of 7 additional hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that  will be deployed by the close of 
2017. SARTA’s transit vehicles are  data-enabled, and include GP S and feedback functionality. 
Other relevant SARTA infrastruct ure includes an existing centra lized data management system 
that interfaces with and supports S ARTA’s user services (see Section 3.2, above). SARTA also 
maintains infrastructure and computing power dedicated to syste m optimization and optimal, 
real-time tracking and management  of its fleet of transit vehic les. These elements are deployed 
via SARTA’s transit centers, loc ated in the City core, Massillo n, and Belden Village. Finally, 
SARTA owns and operates a CNG fue ling station for its fleet of natural gas vehicles, which is 
slated to be upgraded to a combined CNG/hydrogen facility in th e near future. The City employs 
data collection and management f unctions within its municipal b oundaries, including signal 
monitoring and optimization abilities. The City also maintains ownership and operation of its 
existing sewage treatment facil ity, and associated infrastructu re and electrical systems, which 
would be modified under the Projec t. The Project vision has bee n carefully designed to interface 
with and expand on these elements , to be cohesive with existing  facilities, while providing 
additional and enhanced smart systems functionality. Thus the P roject will incorporate available 
infrastructure into the propose d smart city system. A prelimina ry review of available 
infrastructure and proposed technolo gies indicates that availab le infrastructure could be utilized 
to support the proposed smart sys tems. This will be confirmed d uring the Project planning phase.  
 
12.4 Data Performance and Management 
SARTA and the City will maintai n overall oversight of data perf ormance and management, as 
they do currently. However, the t wo entities will be supported by Project partner Teradata 
through deployment of the Project . Teradata’s IDW (see Section 9.2) system boasts linear 
scalability (by adding physical mac hines linearly with growth in data), low cost of ownership, 
and high reliability needed to support growth in data volumes. Teradata’s UDA (see Section 9.2) 
deploys industry-leading best pr
actices for data performance an d management, specifically 
designed for rapidly emerging ne w data sources, as would be dep loyed under the Project. 
Teradata's three-tier architectur e which separates the tasks of  (1) loading data, (2) structuring it 
in such a way that any query can be supported for any user at a ny time, and (3) enabling any 
agency to develop a specific view  for its purposes with its rul es. The Project team anticipates that 
this will allow Project particip ants to create data-driven applications that draw on the data of the 
entire enterprise, by loading it once and using it many times, avoiding the need for multiple 
environments each with its own performance service levels and m anagement costs. Maintaining 
2/4/2016
29 of 74
SARTA Smart City Proposalone single source copy of enterpr ise data is consistent with ap plicable standards , while creating 
new sources of value from the white space that frequently exist s between data silos. The 
proposed UDA augments the best practice IDW with the Data Platf orm environment, where any 
data can be captured/managed at low cost, and the Discovery Pla tform, which is tailored for 
linking data across the data platform and integrated data wareh ouse.  
 
13.0 Other Financial Resources 
The Project team is committed to advancing infrastructure and p ursuing smart city systems in the 
Project area. To this end, the team is already aggressively seeking and securing additional 
outside funding, that will ultimately support Project implement ation and deployment. The City 
and SARTA view the Project as a  potential planning device for t heir operations and future 
development, and plan to seek a dditional funds to support that vision. The Project team and 
anticipates that in-kind match ma y be available, in the form of  labor and/or facilities that would 
be forwarded by the Project team . With respect to additional cash funding, SARTA has already 
secured $8.9 million in prior federal grant funding in 2014, wh ich is supporting d eployment of 
advanced hydrogen fuel cell vehi cles, to be deployed alongside the Project, and utilized by the 
Project. SARTA has also received grant commitments totaling $4 million from the Ohio DOT, 
$5.4 million from the National Fuel Cell Program, and $2 million from the Federal Transit 
Authority section 5307. SARTA is a lso in the process of pursuin g several additional sources of 
grant funding, including through s trategic partnerships with Oh io State University, as well as 
public/private partnerships rela ting to the deployment of advan ced clean transit technologies.  
 
Various other potential funding mec hanisms may be available to help support the Project. For 
example, as recently as 2013, SARTA, the City of Canton, and th e State of Ohio collaborated to 
deploy major transit updates wit hin the Mahoning Road Corridor and 12th Street. The project 
includes multiple phases to taling over $56 million in work, mad e available primarily through 
state grant funds, with some additional local funding. It is a pinnacle project that closely 
interfaces with other smart city/c omplete streets elements, inc luding those proposed under the 
Project. Key features will incl ude new transit facilities, bike  lanes, road modifications, new 
traffic control systems and a traffic control center, safety im provements, and roadway lighting, 
supporting select elements of tra nsit-oriented development. The Project team will work internally 
and with other local, state, and po ssibly federal agencies to h elp identify additional match 
funding during initial pro ject development.
