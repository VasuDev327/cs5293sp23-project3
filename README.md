**Key points**:\
Initially, a model was developed using Jupyter Notebook in this project.\
Subsequently, this model was utilized in the .py file to make predictions for the new .pdf file.\
The output of this process is a .tsv file.\

### Step 1:
To start the project, all the 71 files available in the instructor's Git repository were downloaded, which included both .doc and .pdf files.\
However, only the pdf files were considered for this project.\
Once the raw text was extracted from these pdf files, the city and state names were extracted from the file names.\
This information was then stored in a data frame, as illustrated below.
